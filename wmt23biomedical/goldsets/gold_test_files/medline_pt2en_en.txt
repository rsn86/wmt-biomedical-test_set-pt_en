doc1	1	to characterize the performance in oral narrative discourse of adolescents from 6 to 9 years of age from an elementary school, as well as to verify the influence of gender, school year, age, performance in oral language tests, memory, and appointment of figures.
doc1	2	100 adolescents of both genders from the sixth to the ninth years of elementary school who did not have any language or learning disorders were evaluated for oral narrative discourse (MAC Battery), visual figure nomination (Boston Naming Test), oral language and memory (NEUPSILIN).
doc1	3	Performance was considered as a response variable in narrative discourse (partial and complete retelling and the ability to answer questions).
doc1	4	After univariate analysis, Multiple Linear Regression models were constructed.
doc1	5	Only general performance in the naming task was considered as a predictor of performance in oral narrative discourse.
doc1	6	A direct association between the variables of narrative discourse and the naming of figures was present.
doc1	7	We show the characteristics of adolescents' performance in the partial and complete retelling and in the answers to the questions by age, school year and sex.
doc1	8	in the studied sample the participants (aged from two to seven years old) were able to understand and detail an oral narrative discourse similar to adults with a low educational level, consequently the MAC Battery narrative discourse test can be used to assess adolescents without any requirements for adaptation.

doc8	5	The anthropometric data (body mass index and waist circumference), the lifestyle (Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents and television time), economic and demographic data were evaluated.
doc8	6	Polytomous logistic regression assessed associations of interest by STATA, version 16.0.
doc8	7	Overweight (OR:9,7; CI95%:5,4-17,5) and abdominal obesity (OR:14,0; CI95%: 5,0-39,3) were positively associated with body dissatisfaction.
doc8	8	However, there was no association with lifestyle variables (physical activity: OR: 1,7, CI: 0,9-2,9, and TV time: OR:1,2; CI:0,8-1,9).
doc8	9	The conclusion reached is that anthropometric status is an essential indicator of adverse body image outcomes in adolescents.
doc12	1	This article, in an essay format, seeks to establish a dialogue between the ethics of care and pediatric palliative care, taking into consideration the fact that moral perceptions are based on a network of relationships, while care is built on intersubjectivity.
doc12	2	Four pillars that are referred to as movements are discussed: the ethics of care, as a feminist ethic, in a dialogue with pediatric palliative care, and communication and autonomy as tools of care based on their relational aspects.
doc12	3	The conclusion drawn is that considering these aspects from a palliative standpoint can be a way to implement a moral commitment of care.
doc14	1	The objective of this work was to review published scientific works on leprosy as a public health problem in Brazil, and the marker of vulnerability for people with the disease.
doc14	2	A scoping review was carried out with the descriptor 'leprosy AND vulnerability', on the Virtual Health Library (BVS) database.
doc14	3	A total of 29 articles published between January 2016 and December 2020 that met the inclusion criteria were selected.
doc14	4	The results pointed to scientific papers published in indexed journals and with different impact factors, with emphasis on the fact that most of the selected publications appear in journals with impact metrics that are not very significant in the eyes of the international community, even though they have national impact.
doc14	5	The majority of the studies had municipal coverage, with emphasis on cities in the North and Northeast of Brazil.

doc13	1	Spatial analysis can help measure the spatial accessibility of health services with a view to improving the allocation of health care resources.
doc13	2	The objective of this study was to analyze the spatial distribution of COVID-19 detection rates and health care resources in Brazil's Amazon region.
doc13	3	We conducted an ecological study using data on COVID-19 cases and the availability of health care resources in 772 municipalities during two waves of the pandemic.
doc13	4	Local and global Bayesian estimation were used to construct choropleth maps.
doc13	5	Moran's I was calculated to detect the presence of spatial dependence and Moran maps were used to identify disease clusters.
doc13	6	In both periods, Moran's I values indicate the presence of positive spatial autocorrelation in distributions and spatial dependence between municipalities, with only a slight difference between the two estimators.
doc13	7	The findings also reveal that case rates were highest in the states of Amapá, Amazonas, and Roraima.
doc13	8	The data suggest that health care resources were inefficiently allocated, with higher concentrations of ventilators and ICU beds being found in state capitals.
doc18	1	To identify spatial variability of mortality from breast and cervical cancer and to assess factors associated in the city of São Paulo. Between 2009 and 2016, 10,124 deaths from breast cancer and 2,116 deaths from cervical cancer were recorded in the Mortality Information System among women aged 20 years and over.
doc18	2	The records were geocoded by address of residence and grouped according to Primary Health Care coverage areas.
doc18	3	A spatial regression modeling was put together using the Bayesian approach with a Besag-York-Mollié structure to verify the association of deaths with selected indicators.
doc18	4	Mortality rates from these types of cancer showed inverse spatial patterns.
doc18	5	These variables were associated with breast cancer mortality: travel time between one and two hours to work (RR - relative risk: 0.97; 95%CI - credible interval: 0.93-1.00); women being the head of the household (RR 0.97; 95%CI 0.94-0.99) and deaths from breast cancer in private health institutions (RR 1.04; 95%CI 1.00-1.07).
doc18	6	The following variables were associated with mortality from cervical cancer: travel time to work between half an hour and one hour (RR 0.92; 95%CI 0.87-0.98); per capita household income of up to 3 minimum wages (RR 1.27; 95%CI 1.18-1.37) and ratio of children under one year of age related to the female population aged 15 to 49 years (RR 1.09; 95%CI 1.01-1.18).

doc28	1	The consolidation of practices aimed at enhancing resilience corroborates the current paradigm shift within the scope of adolescent health promotion, in which the individual's singularity is considered, as well as his/her relationship with the environment.
doc28	2	The scope of the undertaking was to identify protective factors involved in the process of resilience among adolescents.
doc28	3	This paper reviews indexed publications describing adolescent care models and interventions.
doc28	4	The analysis of the texts consisted of: 1) comparing the similarities and differences between the concepts used; and 2) identifying, grouping and compiling the most cited protection factors.
doc28	5	A total of 17 articles that strive to enhance resilience in six different practical contexts were analyzed.
doc28	6	Based on the protection factors found, 17 actions were generated to guide the development of educational works in health.
doc28	7	Protective factors related to 'Problem solving', 'Valorization of the individual' and 'Ability in communication' were identified in several contexts of study on adolescence.
doc28	8	These factors represent transversal aspects necessary to enhance resilience and should be stimulated together in order to foster the healthy development of adolescents.
doc29	1	This cross-sectional study aimed to analyze the sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics associated with the consumption of in natura or minimally processed and ultra-processed foods (UPFs) by adolescents in the Metropolitan Region of Greater Vitória, in Espírito Santo, Brazil.
doc29	2	The data were obtained between 2016 and 2017.
doc29	3	Logistic regression was adopted for the multivariate analysis.
doc29	4	A total of 2,285 adolescents aged between 15 and 19 participated in the study.
doc29	5	Greater consumption of minimally processed foods was associated with the adolescent doing paid work (OR=1.27; 95%CI=1.04-1.56), a high family income (OR=1.5; 95%CI=1.10-2.17), and engagement in physical activity (OR=1.9; 95%CI=1.45-2.63).
doc29	6	Having brown/black skin (OR=1.3; 95%CI=1.02-1.61) and the habit of eating while surfing the web (OR=1.4; 95%CI=1.02-1.88) increased the chances of consuming UPFs.
doc29	7	Being enrolled in a private school and being in the third/fourth year of high school reduced UPF consumption by 41.7% and 37.2%, respectively.
doc29	8	It is concluded that greater purchasing power and engagement in physical activity influenced the consumption of minimally processed foods.
doc29	9	On the other hand, self-reporting as brown/black and internet use increased the chances of greater UPF consumption.
doc30	1	Adequate nutrition has a profound impact on older adults' health.
doc30	2	Therefore, special attention should be given to the dietetic intake of added sugars, which in excess is associated with poorer control of chronic diseases in this phase.
doc30	3	The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of consumption of added sugars in older adults in the Campinas-SP region, its associated factors, and its main dietary sources.
doc30	4	A cross-sectional study was conducted in the region of Campinas-SP, with a convenience sample of 586 older individuals.
doc30	5	Intake was obtained using two 24-hour food recalls, and values >5% of total energy consumption were considered inadequate.
doc30	6	The contribution of the groups and foods in relation to the total content of sugars was also calculated.
doc30	7	A critical level of p<0.05 was considered.
doc30	8	The average intake of added sugars was higher than recommended (7.0%), and this inadequacy was observed in more than half of the sample, being table sugar and honey the main dietary sources.
doc30	9	The prevalence of inadequate consumption was higher among women (69.8%; p=0.004) and individuals with low weight (83.7%; p=0.014), and lower in those with diabetes (47.8%; p<0.001).
doc30	10	Results indicate that health and nutrition actions should be developed to ensure adequate sugar intake at this stage.
doc31	1	The scope of this study is to identify determining factors of disparities in social conditions in the health of non-institutionalized elderly people in the city of São Paulo, from the standpoint of self-declaration of skin color.
doc31	2	It is a cross-sectional study with a representative sample of 1,017 elderly participants in the '2015 Health Survey of the Municipality of São Paulo'.
doc31	3	The analysis used crude and adjusted Poisson regression models, reporting the prevalence ratio and 95% confidence intervals as a measure of association between the variables.
doc31	4	In the adjusted analysis, brown and black skin color was positively associated with worse schooling, negative self-assessment of health status, health insurance and access to public health services.
doc31	5	On the one hand, black skin color was no longer associated with the lowest income, however, it was associated with arterial hypertension.
doc31	6	On the other hand, brown skin color was associated with low income, but not with arterial hypertension.
doc31	7	Elderly black and brown people had worse health conditions, less access to private health services and socioeconomic resources.
doc31	8	These results are compatible with the hypothesis of structural racism in São Paulo's society and may inform social health policies aimed at promoting health and social justice.
doc32	1	In the atherosclerotic plaque microenvironment, oxidized phospholipids expressed in the oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) surface bind to scavenger receptors of macrophages eliciting foam cell formation and plaque progression.
doc32	2	Auto-antibodies against oxLDL (oxLDL-Ab) interact with oxidative epitopes leading to the formation of immune complexes that are unable to interact with macrophage receptors, thus abrogating atherogenesis.
doc32	3	Release of oxLDL-Ab by B cells involves interleukin 5 and Th2 response, which in turn are potentiated by HDL.
doc32	4	Thereby, we hypothesized that individuals with higher levels of HDL-C may plausibly display elevated titers of oxLDL-Ab.
doc32	5	To evaluate the relationship between HDL-C and oxLDL-Ab levels.
doc32	6	Asymptomatic individuals (n = 193) were grouped according to their HDL-C concentration to one of three categories: low (< 68 mg/dL), intermediate (68 to 80 mg/dL) or high (> 80 mg/dL).
doc32	7	P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
doc32	8	Our analysis included 193 individuals (mean age: 47 years; male: 26.3%).
doc32	9	Compared to individuals in the lowest HDL-C tertile, those in the highest tertile were older (36 versus 53 years; p = 0.001) and less frequently male (42.6% versus 20.9%; p = 0.001).
doc32	10	Mean values of oxLDL-Ab increased as the HDL-C group escalated (0.31, 0.33 and 0.43 units, respectively; p = 0.001 for trend).
doc32	11	Simple linear regression found a significant, positive relationship between the independent variable, HDL-C, and the dependent variable, oxLDL-Ab (R = 0.293; p = 0.009).
doc32	12	This relation remained significant (R = 0.30; p = 0.044), after adjustment by covariates.
doc32	13	Apolipoprotein AI levels were also related to oxLDL-Ab in both simple and adjusted linear regression models.
doc32	14	HDL-C and oxLDL-Ab are independently related.
doc9	1	The scope of this study was to investigate the prevalence of food insecurity in the context of COVID-19 and its association with the emergency aid income-transfer program and the collecting of food donations by the population in a situation of social vulnerability.
doc9	2	A cross-sectional study was carried out with socially vulnerable families eight months after confirming the first case of COVID-19 in Brazil.
doc9	3	A total of 903 families, living in 22 underprivileged communities of Maceió, in the state of Alagoas, were included.
doc9	4	Sociodemographic characteristics were evaluated, and the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale was applied.
doc9	5	The association of food insecurity with the variables studied was performed using Poisson regression with robust variance estimation, considering α = 5%.
doc9	6	Of the total sample, 71.1% were food insecure, a situation associated with receiving food donations (PR = 1.14; 95%CI: 1.02; 1.27) and being a beneficiary of emergency aid (PR =1.23; 95%CI: 1.01; 1.49).
doc9	7	The results show that the population in a situation of social vulnerability was strongly affected by food insecurity.
doc9	8	On the other hand, the population group in question benefited from actions implemented at the outset of the pandemic.
doc33	1	Sedentary behavior has been associated with several cardiometabolic risk factors during childhood.
doc33	2	However, little is known about the impact of sedentary behavior on the health and eating habits of physically active children and adolescents.
doc33	3	To evaluate the association between sedentary behavior and cardiometabolic risk factors and eating habits in physically active children and adolescents.
doc33	4	This cross-sectional study was conducted, including 516 physically active children and adolescents (10 to 18 years old; both sexes) enrolled in the social project 'Estação Conhecimento-Vale' were evaluated.
doc33	5	Biochemical and lifestyle variables (questionnaire) were collected.
doc33	6	Sedentary behavior was determined indirectly (questionnaire), by using sitting time ≥ 3 hours per day as a cutoff point.
doc33	7	A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all tests.
doc33	8	Sedentary behavior was not associated with overweight/obesity (odds ratio = 0.72 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.325-1.389]), hypertriglyceridemia (odds ratio = 0.63 [95% CI: 0.306-1.297]), low HDL cholesterol (odds ratio = 0.57 [95% CI: 0.323-1.019]), or high non-HDL cholesterol (odds ratio = 0.63 [95% CI: 0.283-1.389]).
doc33	9	However, children and adolescents with sedentary behavior were more likely to regularly consume food in front of the television (odds ratio = 1.96 [95% CI: 1.114-3.456]) and to consume at least one ultra-processed food per day (odds ratio = 2.42 [95% CI: 1.381-4.241]).
doc33	10	In addition, they were less likely to consume fruit regularly (odds ratio = 0.52 [95% CI: 0.278-0.967]).
doc33	11	There was no association between sedentary behavior and cardiometabolic risk factors in physically active children and adolescents.
doc33	12	However, sedentary behavior was associated with inadequate eating habits.
doc33	13	Thus, we may suggest that the regular engagement in physical activity may attenuate the deleterious effects of sedentary behavior on the cardiometabolic parameters of children and adolescents.

doc6	2	analytical cross-sectional study carried out with a total of 449 nurses.
doc6	3	Data collection was performed using instruments validated in Peru.
doc6	4	In the analysis, the Shapiro-Wilk test and the Spearman correlation coefficient were used, and two multiple regression models were estimated, with variable selection in stages.
doc6	5	nurses had a moderate level of fatalism and a low level of fear and concern about COVID-19.
doc6	6	The first statistical model, which included sociodemographic variables, explains only 3% of the fatalism variance.
doc6	7	However, a second model that includes fear and perception explains 33% of it.
doc6	8	Worry, fear and having been diagnosed with COVID-19 were predictors of fatalism.
doc6	9	It is suggested the implementation of psycho-emotional interventions in daily work - aimed at Nursing professionals who present high levels of fear or concern - to reduce fatalism and prevent fatal consequences of the pandemic and promote health.

doc34	6	The questionnaire mean ICC was 0.742 and ranged from -0.012 to 0.698 for the auditory tasks.
doc34	7	Based on mean results and upper limit of the CI, the findings showed agreement between moments, classified as good for the questionnaire and moderate to good for five of the seven auditory analyzed tasks (ICC>0.05 and <0.9).
doc34	8	The results of the reliability study represent an important parameter for validating the program for the studied age group.
doc11	1	To compare the efficiency of different vocal self-assessment instruments for dysphonia screening.
doc11	2	262 dysphonic and non-dysphonic individuals participated in the research.
doc11	3	The mean age was 41.3 (±14.5) years.
doc11	4	The diagnosis of dysphonia was based on the auditory-perceptual analysis of the sustained vowel 'é' and on laryngological diagnosis.
doc11	5	The responses of the instruments were collected: Voice-Related Quality of Life (V-RQOL), Voice Handicap Index (VHI), VHI-10, Voice Symptoms Scale (VoiSS), and the Brazilian Dysphonia Screening Tool, (Br-DST) called in Brazilian Portuguese Instrumento de Rastreio da Disfonia (IRDBR).
doc11	6	To analyze assertiveness in relation to the presence of dysphonia, the cutoff points of each instrument and the decision rule recommended by the IRDBR were used.
doc11	7	An exploratory analysis was performed to compare mean scores of instruments and verify associations between variables.
doc11	8	The instruments evaluated were sensitive to capture the impact of dysphonia in a similar way regardless of professional voice use and type of dysphonia.
doc11	9	There was a difference only in VoiSS scores for the variable gender, with a higher score for females.

doc35	1	The aging of the population has led to an increased prevalence of chronic diseases such as chronic kidney disease.
doc35	2	Anemia is one of the most frequent complications of chronic kidney disease, with an impact not only on the quality of life but also on the patient's prognosis and associated costs.
doc35	3	Knowledge in this therapeutic area has increased significantly: from the appearance of recombinant erythropoietin in 1989, through the use of increasing doses of parenteral iron and, more recently, to new molecules such as hypoxia-inducible factor inhibitors.
doc35	4	The aim of this article is to present a pragmatic review of the state of the art in the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease.
doc36	1	This study aimed to theorize, by means of social actors' conception, about the reasons for the non-inclusion of oral health in the Family Health Strategy (FHS) in the city of Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, Brazil.
doc36	2	This is a qualitative, exploratory, descriptive, and analytical study based on the grounded theory methodology and the National Oral Health Policy.
doc36	3	Eleven interviews were performed with public managers, delegates who participate in the municipal health council, and dental surgeons who belong to the public health service.
doc36	4	The theorization of the study was created through the data analysis process, which resulted in 'a consequence of the dominant disease-centered oral health care model' as the main category.
doc36	5	Data were categorized according to a methodological framework.
doc36	6	The health concept set forth by local social actors contributed to the non-inclusion of oral healthcare teams (OHTs) in the FHS.
doc36	7	This theorization identified the origins of the studied phenomenon and can aid in future policy decision-making carried out by local social actors.
doc37	1	To verify the relationship between the rectus femoris cross-sectional area and diaphragmatic excursion with successful weaning from mechanical ventilation in chronic critically tracheostomized patients.
doc37	2	This was a prospective observational cohort study.
doc37	3	We included chronic critically ill patients (those who underwent tracheostomy placement after 10 days under mechanical ventilation).
doc37	4	The rectus femoris cross-sectional area and diaphragmatic excursion were obtained by ultrasonography performed within the first 48 hours after tracheostomy.
doc37	5	We measured rectus femoris cross-sectional area and diaphragmatic excursion to assess their association with weaning from mechanical ventilation, including their potential to predict successful weaning and survival throughout the intensive care unit stay.
doc37	6	Eighty-one patients were included.
doc37	7	Forty-five patients (55%) were weaned from mechanical ventilation.
doc37	8	The mortality rates were 42% and 61.7% in the intensive care unit and hospital, respectively.
doc37	9	The fail group in relation to the success group at weaning presented a lower rectus femoris cross-sectional area (1.4 [0.8] versus 1.84 [0.76]cm2, p = 0.014) and lower diaphragmatic excursion (1.29 ± 0.62 versus 1.62 ± 0.51cm, p = 0.019).
doc37	10	When rectus femoris cross-sectional area ≥ 1.80cm2 and diaphragmatic excursion ≥ 1.25cm was a combined condition, it had a strong association with successful weaning (adjusted OR = 20.81, 95%CI 2.38 - 182.28; p = 0.006) but not with intensive care unit survival (adjusted OR = 0.19, 95%CI 0.03 - 1.08; p = 0.061).
doc37	11	Successful weaning from mechanical ventilation in chronic critically ill patients was associated with higher measurements of rectus femoris cross-sectional area and diaphragmatic excursion.
doc38	1	Participation in health has generated a large number of publications around the world.
doc38	2	In order to know the specificities of this production in the Americas, a bibliometric analysis of articles in English, Spanish and Portuguese was carried out.
doc38	3	Searches were carried out in the VHL, PubMed, SCOPUS, WOS and SciELO, consolidating a database with 641 references.

doc42	1	A new clinical manifestation called post or long coronavirus disease (p/l COVID) has walked into our lives after the acute COVID-19 phase.
doc42	2	P/l COVID may lead to myocardial injury with subsequent cardiac problems.
doc42	3	Diagnosing these patients quickly and simply has become more important due to the increasing number of patients with p/l COVID.
doc42	4	We compared strain echocardiography (SE) parameters of patients who suffered from atypical chest pain and had sequel myocarditis findings on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR).
doc42	5	We aimed to investigate the value of SE for detection of myocardial involvement in patients with p/l COVID.
doc42	6	A total of 42 patients were enrolled.
doc42	7	Our population was separated into two groups.
doc42	8	The CMR(-) group (n = 21) had no myocardial sequelae on CMR, whereas the CMR(+) group had myocardial sequelae on CMR (n = 21).
doc42	9	The predictive value of SE for myocarditis was also evaluated by age-adjusted multivariate analysis.
doc42	10	P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
doc42	11	When compared with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), global longitudinal strain (GLS) and global circumferential strain (GCS) had a stronger relationship (LVEF, p = 0.05; GLS, p < 0.001; GCS, p < 0.001) with p/l COVID associated myocardial involvement.
doc42	12	GLS < 20.35 had 85.7% sensitivity and 81% specificity; GCS < 21.35 had 81% sensitivity and 81% specificity as diagnostic values for myocardial sequelae detected with CMR.
doc42	13	While there was no difference between the groups in terms of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, p = 0.31), a difference was observed between biochemical markers, which are indicators of cardiac involvement (brain natriuretic peptide, p < 0.001).
doc42	14	SE is more useful than traditional echocardiography for making diagnosis quickly and accurately in order not to delay treatment in the presence of myocardial involvement.
doc10	1	This study seeks to culturally and ethically reflect on the current and future challenges of incorporating new biotechnologies to diagnose and treat cancer in Brazil and assess their impact on cancer control.
doc10	2	To this end, this study begins by problematizing the literature on the subject and the results of a study that conducted a web survey with medical specialists from the Brazilian public and private sectors; the latter associated with the ten most representative cancer societies in the country, working in clinical practice, surgery, radiotherapy, pathology, and diagnosis.
doc10	3	We discussed this study around three thematic axes: knowledge and expectations on the advent of new technologies to diagnose and treat cancer; structural and ethical considerations in the current and future use of new technologies; and possible scenarios associated with the use and application of new technologies to diagnose and treat cancer.
doc10	4	We have raised some questions: will new technological paradigms benefit all Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS) users, or will they be the privileges of the few? Will they reduce discrepancies regarding the distribution of technological services and resources and cancer diagnosis and treatment? How can different segments of society participate and influence this process? What scenarios can still compose this picture? Aiming to contribute to planning the future of cancer care in Brazil, this study proposes the development of future actions from five strategic dimensions: economy; science, innovation and technology; structure; culture; and regulation.

doc16	11	It is necessary to redirect the planning of health actions in the municipality, with changes in the health care policy of the elderly, and especially in the social support networks that support these individuals, considering that in this locality the presence of multimorbidity was related to socio-economic grounds.
doc48	1	Cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 are important aspects of the disease's pathogenesis and prognosis.
doc48	2	Evidence on the prognostic role of troponin and myocardial injury in Latin American hospitalized COVID-19 patients is still scarce.
doc48	3	To evaluate myocardial injury as independent predictor of in-hospital mortality and invasive mechanical ventilation support in hospitalized patients, from the Brazilian COVID-19 Registry.
doc48	4	This cohort study is a substudy of the Brazilian COVID-19 Registry, conducted in 31 Brazilian hospitals of 17 cities, March-September 2020.
doc48	5	Primary outcomes included in-hospital mortality and invasive mechanical ventilation support.
doc48	6	Models for the primary outcomes were estimated by Poisson regression with robust variance, with statistical significance of p<0.05.
doc48	7	Of 2,925 patients (median age of 60 years [48-71], 57.1% men), 27.3% presented myocardial injury.
doc48	8	The proportion of patients with comorbidities was higher among patients with cardiac injury (median 2 [1-2] vs. 1 [0-2]).
doc48	9	Patients with myocardial injury had higher median levels of brain natriuretic peptide, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and C-reactive protein than patients without myocardial injury.
doc48	10	As independent predictors, C-reactive protein and platelet counts were related to the risk of death, and neutrophils and platelet counts were related to the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation support.
doc48	11	Patients with high troponin levels presented a higher risk of death (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.60-2.58) and invasive mechanical ventilation support (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.57-2.23), when compared to those with normal troponin levels.
doc48	12	Cardiac injury was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation support in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
doc50	1	In the last years, several diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers have been studied in cardiovascular disease.
doc50	2	Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), a cytokine belonging to the transforming growth factor- (TGF-) family, is highly up-regulated in stress and inflammatory conditions and has been correlated to myocardial injury and pressure cardiac overload in animal models.
doc50	3	This new biomarker has been positively correlated with increased risk of cardiovascular events in population studies and shown an independent predictor of mortality in patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure.
doc50	4	This review aimed to summarize the current evidence on the diagnostic and prognostic value of GDF-15 in different settings in cardiology.
doc43	1	to analyze the cost-effectiveness and calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of multilayer compressive treatment in relation to inelastic (Unna boot and short stretch) therapy according to the current literature.
doc43	2	quantitative study about cost-effectiveness through modeling with the aid of TreeAge® software for construction of the decision tree.
doc43	3	The anticipated assumptions were obtained by using secondary literature data to estimate the cost and effectiveness of the assumed parameters.
doc43	4	A systematic literature review with meta-analysis was performed for this end.
doc43	5	the decision tree after Roll Back showed that the multilayer therapy dominated the alternatives in the base case, representing an intermediate cost per application, although with the highest effectiveness.
doc43	6	The cost-effectiveness analysis graph also showed extended dominance of the Unna boot in relation to the short stretch bandage.
doc43	7	The sensitivity analysis showed that multilayer bandage remains a more cost-effective alternative, within the threshold of willingness to pay.
doc43	8	the most cost-effective alternative was multilayer bandage, considered the gold standard in the literature.
doc43	9	The second most cost-effective alternative was the Unna boot, the most used therapy in Brazil.
doc25	1	Considering demographic data related to the cardiologist's fields of work in Brazil, the administrative board of the InCor medical residency program decided for an update of its curriculum content, to adapt the educational process to the cardiologist's work reality.
doc25	2	This article aimed to describe the recent updates applied to the InCor medical residency program.
doc25	3	In the article, we described the recent updates on the InCor residency program, and compared the current curriculum track with the previous one.
doc25	4	We also presented the rationale for these changes, based on the literature on the participation of cardiologists in the labor market.
doc25	5	There was a reduction in the working hours of residents in training in the intensive care unit, and an increase in the outpatient activities of primary and secondary prevention.
doc25	6	Also, the didactic content was reformulated and became organized by the corresponding division.
doc25	7	The update of the curriculum track of the InCor medical residency program was required in order to adapt it to the Brazilian labor market.
doc25	8	The commission in charge of this update is aware that this is a dynamic process that may need changes over time.
