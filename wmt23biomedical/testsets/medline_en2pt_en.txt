doc11	6	The models included eosinophil and neutrophil counts as potential predictors and were adjusted by sex, age, smoking status, AE-COPD-B, treatment with bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).
doc11	7	Sixty-eight patients were considered, 36 bEOS- (<170 cells/μL, the median value) and 32 bEOS+ (≥170 cells/μL).
doc11	8	∆FEV1 was higher in bEOS+ than bEOS- (34.86 mL/yr vs 4.49 mL/yr, p=0.029).
doc11	9	After adjusting for potential confounders, the eosinophil count was positively (β=19.4; CI 95% 2.8, 36.1; p=0.022) and ICS negatively (β=-57.7; CI 95% -91.5,-23.9; p=0.001) associated with lung function decline.
doc11	10	bEOS were not found to be associated with the number of AE-COPD-F. In stable COPD patients, a higher level of blood eosinophils (albeit in the normal range) predicts a greater FEV1 decline, while ICS are associated with a slower progression of airflow obstruction.

doc28	11	Liver decompensated before TACE refractoriness in 51 (51.5%) patients, and the median time to liver decompensation was 14 (IQR 8-20) months after first TACE.
doc28	12	In multivariate analysis, beyond up-to-7 criteria (HR 2.4, <i>p</i> = 0.031), albumin <35 mg/dL (HR 3.5, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and absence of ORR (HR 2.4, <i>p</i> = 0.020) were associated with decreased overall survival free of liver decompensation.
doc28	13	Moreover, beyond up-to-7 criteria, albumin <35 mg/dL and absence of ORR associated negatively with 6-month survival free of liver decompensation.
doc28	14	Our model created using those variables was able to predict liver decompensation at 6 months with an AUROC of 0.701 (<i>p</i> = 0.02).
doc28	15	The absence of ORR after initial TACE, beyond up-to-7 criteria and albumin <35 mg/dL, was a predictive factor for early liver decompensation before TACE refractoriness in our population.
doc28	16	Such patients might benefit from treatment escalation to systemic therapy, in monotherapy or in combination with TACE.
doc48	1	Knowledge of the embryonic development of species such as quail is important for our understanding of its production and reproduction.
doc48	2	Quail provides a practical solution to the animal protein shortage problem in developing countries and is an excellent alternative to chicken (Shanaway, 1994).
doc48	3	This study evaluated quail embryonic viability by comparing the main morphological changes that occur over the development in a homemade incubator with previous data; the incubator was built using easily accessible and low-cost materials, which allows small producers and communities to develop quail farms as an activity to increase income or even produce a source of animal protein for the community in the Brazilian Amazon region.
doc48	4	The homemade incubator measured 40 cm × 42 cm × 32 cm and was constructed with wooden boards, a digital thermostat, and an incandescent lamp.
doc48	5	A total of 24 fertile eggs were incubated at a temperature of 37.5 °C and 60% relative humidity; age '0' was set at the start of incubation.
doc48	6	Two eggs were opened on each day of development, starting from day 5 to day 16 of incubation.
doc48	7	After gently opening the eggs, the embryos were removed, separated from the placenta and amniotic fluid, washed with running water, and weighed on a digital scale (SHIMADZU AUY 220 brand and UNI BLOC model).
doc48	8	Crown-rump length and other measurements were performed with a digital caliper and the morphological structures were observed using a stereomicroscope (NOVA brand and NOVA ZTX-E model).
doc48	9	All eggs opened contained live embryos, indicating that the homemade incubator temperature, relative humidity, and manual turning were adequate to maintain the quail's viability.
doc48	10	The morphometric data of the embryos at different developmental time points were similar to those described in the literature.
doc48	11	Embryos weighed 0.0069 g at day 5 and 4.7863 g at day 16, and the crown-rump length (CRL) means were 0.368 cm and 3.657 cm, respectively.
doc48	12	Weight and CRL increased by 0.434 g and 2.593 cm per day of incubation, respectively.
doc48	13	In conclusion, after 16 days of incubation in a homemade incubator, the embryos presented all phases of the development cycle, with appropriate development of weight and height based on the days of incubation without anomaly or external interference.
doc48	14	These findings demonstrate that the homemade incubator does not alter the embryonic development of quail embryos in the Brazilian Amazon region.
doc45	1	Chronic otitis externa (OE) in dogs frequently requires anaesthetised ear flushing.
doc45	2	To evaluate hypochlorous acid as an ear flushing and antimicrobial agent in dogs with chronic OE.
doc45	3	Twenty dogs with chronic OE caused by the same organisms bilaterally.
doc45	4	One ear was flushed under anaesthesia with hypochlorous acid, the other with saline solution.
doc45	5	Subsequently, the ear flushed with hypochlorous acid was cleaned with the same solution twice daily for 2 weeks, the other ear with a commercial ear cleaner.
doc45	6	An ear medication containing miconazole, polymyxin B and prednisolone was used once daily in both ears.
doc45	7	Clinical scores were determined before the flush.
doc45	8	Ear cytological results were obtained, a hearing test was conducted before and after the ear flush, and a culture was taken directly after flushing.
doc45	9	Ears were evaluated after 2 weeks of therapy.
doc45	10	Yeast was present in the ears of 11, cocci in one and a mixed infection in eight dogs.
doc45	11	Five ears were negative on culture after flushing with hypochlorous acid, one after the saline flush.
doc45	12	Clinical and cytological scores decreased significantly with both solutions after 2 weeks of treatment.
doc45	13	There was no difference between treatments in any of the scores at any time point between treatments and in the results of the hearing test before and after the flushing procedure.
doc45	14	Adverse effects were not seen.
doc45	15	Hypochlorous acid is a suitable cleaning solution for canine OE.
doc39	1	Determination of predictors that can affect development of atherosclerosis progression in the postoperative period is an urgent problem in vascular surgery.
doc39	2	Integrated assessment of markers of apoptosis and cell proliferation in atherosclerotic lesions and their progression after surgery in patients with peripheral arterial diseases.
doc39	3	The investigation included 30 patients with stage IIB-III peripheral arterial disease.
doc39	4	All patients have undergone open surgical interventions on the arteries of the aorto-iliac and femoral-popliteal segments.
doc39	5	During these interventions, intraoperative specimens were obtained from the vascular wall with atherosclerotic lesions.
doc39	6	The following values were evaluated: VEGF А165, PDGF BB, and sFas.
doc39	7	Samples of normal vascular wall were obtained from post-mortem donors and used as a control group.
doc39	8	The levels of Bax and p53 were increased (p<0.001) in samples from arterial wall with atherosclerotic plaque, while sFas values were reduced (p<0.001), compared to their levels in control samples.
doc39	9	Values of PDGF BB and VEGF A165 were 1.9 and 1.7 times higher in atherosclerotic lesion samples (p=0.001), in comparison with the control group.
doc39	10	The levels of p53 and Bax were increased against a background of reduced sFas levels in samples with progression of atherosclerosis compared to their baseline values in samples with atherosclerotic plaque (p<0.05).
doc39	11	Initially increased values of the Bax marker against a background of reduced sFas values in vascular wall samples from patients with peripheral arterial disease is associated with risk of atherosclerosis progression in the postoperative period.
doc50	1	To assess the association between two colposcopic indices, the Swede score and the 2011 International Federation of Cervical Pathology and Colposcopy (IFCPC) Nomenclature as well as to determine the efficacy of the Swede score with cutoffs of 7 and 8.
doc50	2	In the present cross-sectional pilot study, 34 women who had at least 1 colposcopy-directed biopsy due to abnormal cytology were enrolled.
doc50	3	The colposcopic findings were scored by both the Swede score and the 2011 IFCPC Nomenclature and were compared with each other.
doc50	4	The Kappa coefficient and the McNemar test were used.
doc50	5	Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (NPV and PPV, respectively) were calculated, as well as the effectiveness with cutoffs of 7 and 8 in identifying cervical intraepithelial neoplasm (CIN) 2+ when using the Swede score.
doc50	6	The correlation between the 2 colposcopic indices was 79.41%.
doc50	7	The Kappa coefficient and the McNemar p-value were 0.55 and 0.37, respectively.
doc50	8	The IFCPC Nomenclature had sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV of 85.71, 55.00, 67.64, 57.14, and 84.61%, respectively.
doc50	9	The Swede score had sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV of 100, 63.15, 79.41, 68.18, and 100%, respectively.
doc50	10	A Swede score cutoff of 7 for CIN 2+ detection had a specificity of 94.73%, while with a cutoff of 8 it increased to 100%.
doc50	11	The sensitivity for both values was 60%.
doc50	12	The PPV and NPV for cutoffs of 7 and 8 were 90 and 75 and 100 and 76%, respectively.
doc50	13	Although both colposcopic indices have good reproducibility, the Swede score showed greater accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in identifying CIN 2 + , especially when using a cutoff of 8.
doc26	1	Data on the outcomes of preterm newborns in South American countries are scarce.
doc26	2	Given the great effect of low birth weight (LBW) and/or prematurity on children's neurodevelopment, it is extremely necessary to conduct studies on these phenomena in greater depth in more heterogeneous populations such as those ones from countries with limited resources.
doc26	3	We conducted a comprehensive literature search on databases including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for articles published in Portuguese and English up to March 2021 involving children born and evaluated in Brazil.
doc26	4	The analysis of the risk of bias was adapted from the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement and used to evaluate the methodology of the included studies.
doc26	5	From the eligible trials, 25 articles were selected for qualitative synthesis, and 5 of those, for quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis).
doc26	6	The meta-analyses showed that children born with LBW presented lower scores on motor development when compared with controls (standardized mean difference: -1.15; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: -1.56--0.73]; I<sup>2</sup>: 80%) and also scored lower in terms of cognitive development (standardized mean difference: -0.71; 95% CI: -0.99--0.44; I<sup>2</sup>: 67%).
doc26	7	The results of the present study reinforce that impaired motor and cognitive functions can be a significant long-term outcome of LBW.
doc26	8	The lower the gestational age at delivery, the higher the risk of impairment in those domains.
doc26	9	The study protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database under number CRD42019112403.
doc16	1	To document Grenadian women's knowledge about cervical cancer and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, as well as their attitudes towards primary cervical cancer screening methods.
doc16	2	In this qualitative study, we used focus groups in Grenada to gather information concerning women's knowledge about, attitudes towards and perceptions of screening for cervical cancer and general knowledge about HPV.
doc16	3	Ten focus groups comprising 73 participants representing 5 of the 6 parishes in Grenada were conducted with women aged 19-59.
doc16	4	Participants were asked about pelvic exams, Pap smears, HPV, reasons for seeking or avoiding cervical cancer screening and how different modalities of testing might affect their decision-making.
doc16	5	Responses were then coded and organized into common themes.
doc16	6	While many respondents had heard of HPV, far fewer knew about its causative role in cervical cancer, how to prevent HPV infection or testing for the high-risk HPV types that cause almost all cases of cervical cancer.
doc16	7	Many participants were aware that cervical cancer screening was beneficial, but numerous barriers to obtaining that screening were noted, including concerns about privacy and stigma, potential discomfort, and the cost and inconvenience involved.
doc16	8	Our findings have implications for future cervical cancer screening efforts in Grenada.
doc16	9	Central to these efforts should be a focus on educating Grenadians about the role of HPV infection in cervical cancer and the importance of early detection through screening.
doc16	10	In addition, addressing issues of stigma and privacy are key to eliminating cervical cancer in Grenada.
doc49	1	In patients with heart failure (HF), due to the relative deficiency of blood volume, neurohormone system activation leads to renal vasoconstriction, which affects the content of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) in the body, while BUN and Cr are easily affected by other factors.
doc49	2	Therefore, BUN/Cr can be used as another marker for the prognosis of HF.
doc49	3	Explore the prognosis of adverse outcome of HF in the high BUN/Cr group compared with the low BUN/Cr group across the full spectrum of ejection fraction.
doc49	4	From 2014 to 2016, symptomatic hospitalized HF patients were recruited and followed up to observe adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
doc49	5	Logistic analysis and COX analysis were performed to determine significance.
doc49	6	p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
doc49	7	In the univariate logistic regression analysis, the high BUN/Cr group had a higher risk of adverse outcome in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).
doc49	8	Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of cardiac death in the HFrEF group was higher than that in the low BUN/Cr group, while the risk of all-cause death was significant only in 3 months (p<0.05) (Central Illustration).
doc49	9	The risk of all-cause death in the high BUN/Cr in the HFpEF group was significantly higher than that in the low BUN/Cr group at two years.
doc49	10	The high BUN/Cr group is related to the risk of poor prognosis of HFpEF, and is not lower than the predictive value of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).
doc10	1	The coexistence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with clinical forms of Parkinson disease (PD), although uncommon, is found to a greater degree than one would expect by chance.
doc10	2	The pathological mechanisms of ALS and PD are still not fully understood, and the coexistence of these two diseases suggests that they could share mechanisms in common.
doc10	3	Here we present a sample of patients with clinically definitive or probable ALS who were evaluated with single-photon emission computed tomography SPECT/TRODAT and compared with non-ALS controls.
doc10	4	Patients with clinically definite or probable ALS were assessed with the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale (ALSFRS) to define severity and had their demographic data collected.
doc10	5	The TRODAT results of patients with ALS were compared with those of patients with a diagnosis of PD with less than 10 years of duration, and with patients with a diagnosis of others movement disorders not associated with neurodegenerative diseases.
doc10	6	A total of 75% of patients with ALS had TRODAT results below the levels considered normal; that was also true for 25% of the patients in the control group without neurodegenerative disease, and for 100% of the patients in the PD group.
doc10	7	A statistically significant difference was found between patients with ALS and the control group without neurodegenerative disease in the TRODAT values < 0.05.
doc10	8	Our study fits with the neuropathological and functional evidence that demonstrates the existence of nigrostriatal dysfunction in patients with ALS.
doc10	9	Further research to better understand the role of these changes in the pathophysiological process of ALS needs to be performed.
