doc1	1	The study aims to evaluate the association between teenage pregnancy and prematurity.
doc1	2	The data are from the Birth in Brazil study, a national survey consisting of 23,894 postpartum women and their newborn infants.
doc1	3	The information was obtained from interviews with the mothers during their postpartum hospital stay.
doc1	4	A matching method was established, based on propensity scores, to deal with differences between the groups due to the non-experimental design of the Birth in Brazil study.
doc1	5	The study outcome was gestational age, considering all the premature births (gestational age < 37 weeks) and term births (gestational age 37 weeks to 41 weeks and 6 days).
doc1	6	The study revealed social, economic, and maternal care disparities between the women according to age bracket.
doc1	7	The highest proportions of teenage mothers were in the least developed regions of Brazil (North and Northeast) and in the poorest economic classes.
doc1	8	After matching for socioeconomic and obstetric care characteristics, the highest odds of spontaneous prematurity were seen in younger adolescents compared to older adolescents (OR = 1.49; 95%CI: 1.07-2.06), and young adults (OR = 2.38; 95%CI: 1.82-3.12).
doc1	9	Prematurity is still an issue in the field of maternal and child health, and the association with teenage pregnancy identified in this study is worrisome, especially because younger adolescent mothers were associated with higher odds of spontaneous prematurity.

doc25	1	After a decade experiencing clear difficulties, the Portuguese National Health Service needs a significant public investment for its development.
doc25	2	This means more resources for the National Health Service, but also an increased capacity to manage its necessary transformation.
doc25	3	Current health challenges differ significantly from those prevailing when the National Health Service was institutionalized, 40 years ago: (i) A significant increase in the prevalence of patients with multimorbidity has been observed;
doc25	4	(ii)There is a need to delay and attenuate the expression of multimorbidity;
doc25	5	(iii) In this context, a strong investment in integrating health care is of a paramount importance.
doc25	6	The transformations that the National Health Service needs to respond to these challenges are very complex and demanding: (i) Effective local adaptive change management requires a very elaborate strategic, governance and government framework, which is yet to be developed;
doc25	7	(ii) Collaborative architectures, processes and tools need to be promoted in order to induce and facilitate change in the Portuguese health system;
doc25	8	(iii) Common understanding of current challenges and increased capabilities to deal with complex change processes may facilitate the implementation of effective strategic management in the National Health Service, focused on its more critical domains - financing, infrastructures and resource management, organizational development, policies for attracting and retaining health professional and cooperation with the social and private sectors.
doc25	9	Such a transformation agenda is urgently needed.
doc26	1	To estimate the reporting rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases for Brazil as a whole and states.
doc26	2	We estimated the actual number of COVID-19 cases using the reported number of deaths in Brazil and each state, and the expected case-fatality ratio from the World Health Organization.
doc26	3	Brazil's expected case-fatality ratio was also adjusted by the population's age pyramid.
doc26	4	Therefore, the notification rate can be defined as the number of confirmed cases (notified by the Ministry of Health) divided by the number of expected cases (estimated from the number of deaths).
doc26	5	The reporting rate for COVID-19 in Brazil was estimated at 9.2% (95%CI 8.8% - 9.5%), with all the states presenting rates below 30%.
doc26	6	São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the most populated states in Brazil, showed small reporting rates (8.9% and 7.2%, respectively).
doc26	7	The highest reporting rate occurred in Roraima (31.7%) and the lowest in Paraiba (3.4%).
doc26	8	The results indicated that the reporting of confirmed cases in Brazil is much lower as compared to other countries we analyzed.
doc26	9	Therefore, decision-makers, including the government, fail to know the actual dimension of the pandemic, which may interfere with the determination of control measures.

doc45	2	To compare historical series of CVD mortality based on data from the SIM, with and without correction, and from the Brazil Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2017, in the 2000-2017 period.
doc45	3	Analysis of CVD mortality in Brazil between 2000 and 2017.
doc45	4	Three CVD mortality estimates were compared: Crude SIM, Corrected SIM, and GBD 2017.
doc45	5	Absolute numbers and age-standardized rates were used to compare the estimates for Brazil, its states and the Federal District.
doc45	6	In the SIM, the total of deaths ranged from 261,000, in 2000, to 359,000, in 2017.
doc45	7	In the GBD 2017, the total of deaths ranged from 292,000 to 388,000, for the same years, respectively.
doc45	8	A high proportion of the causes of death from CVD corresponded to garbage codes, classified according to the GBD 2017, reaching 42% in 2017.
doc45	9	The rates estimated by GBD ranged from 248.8 (1990) to 178.0 (2017) deaths per 100,000 inhabitants.
doc45	10	The rates of the Crude SIM and Corrected SIM also showed a reduction for the whole series analyzed, the Crude SIM showing lower rates: 204.9 (1990) and 155.1 (2017) deaths per 100 thousand inhabitants.
doc45	11	When analyzing by the states and Federal District, the Crude SIM trends reversed, with an increase in mortality rates in the Northern and Northeastern states.
doc45	12	This study shows the decrease in CVD mortality rates in Brazil in the period analyzed.
doc45	13	Conversely, when analyzing by the states and Federal District, the Crude SIM showed an increase in those rates for the Northern and Northeastern states.
doc45	14	The use of crude data from the SIM can result in interpretation errors, indicating an increase in rates, due to the increase in death data capture and the improvement in the definition of the underlying causes of death in the past decade, especially in the Northern and Northeastern regions, justifying the use of corrected data in mortality analyses.

doc48	1	Performance autoethnography is qualitative research methodology that aims to problematize resistances between the "self" (auto-) and the collective (ethno-) in the act of writing (-graphy).
doc48	2	The article thus aims to discuss the theoretical and practical construction of performance autoethnography and its applicability as a qualitative research and analytical method in the field of Collective Health through a performance autoethnography writing.
doc48	3	By problematizing the epistemic and ontological basis of performance autoethnography, pointing to possibilities for its development and inclusion in studies in the field of Collective Health, the article presents performance autoethnography as a strategy to expand the possibilities for social justice, democratization, and pluralisms in and from research practices.
doc48	4	Performance autoethnography, oriented by the episteme "postcolonial", explores decolonializing approaches that provoke and create conditions for the transformation of the academic view itself and the knowledge that prioritizes certain representations of "the other" and thus mainly problematizes how subaltern and marginalized histories relate to what are considered hegemonic systems.
doc49	1	Men are the main group affected by HIV infection in Brazil, with an upward trend in the last 10 years.
doc49	2	According to official data, heterosexual men represent 49% of cases, followed by homosexuals with 38% and bisexuals with 9.1%.
doc49	3	Heterosexual men have been subsumed in the category "overall population" and have failed to receive specific attention in preventive policies or activities.
doc49	4	The article proposes to analyze the circumstances and strategies by which heterosexual men learn of their HIV diagnosis.
doc49	5	The study thus seeks to understand the paths and social actors involved in their HIV/AIDS diagnosis.
doc49	6	The data are from a qualitative study interviewing 36 men living with HIV/AIDS that did not self-identify as homosexuals and/or bisexuals.
doc49	7	The men were contacted in three specialized AIDS services in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil.
doc49	8	The results indicate that men consider themselves immune to HIV, and that the diagnosis is an unexpected event.
doc49	9	Women (affective-sexual partners and/or former partners) are fundamental components in the men's diagnosis, since they reveal the presence of HIV through either prenatal care or their own illness.
doc49	10	An important share of these men discover that they are HIV-positive through some illness such as tuberculosis or after several visits to health services.
doc49	11	Spontaneous search for HIV testing only occurs through situations and signs associated with possible infection.
doc49	12	Heterosexual men have few opportunities for HIV diagnosis, and beyond gender issues, they are subject to programmatic vulnerability.
doc50	1	To investigate associations between functioning, community participation, and quality of life (QoL) and identify whether participation mediates the effects of functioning on QoL.
doc50	2	The caregivers of 435 children (211 females, 224 males; mean age 12y; SD 3y 11mo; age range 5-18y) with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, or Rett syndrome reported on their child's functioning (dependence for managing personal needs, mobility, communication, eye contact when speaking), frequency of participation, and QoL. Linear regression and mediation analyses were used to evaluate the relationships between child functioning, participation, and QoL. Children with greater dependency for managing personal needs and limited eye contact when speaking experienced poorer QoL. Less impaired functioning was associated with more frequent participation, which, in turn, was associated with a 3-point gain in QoL for each additional point in frequency of participation (coefficient=2.67, 95% confidence interval 1.56-3.78).
doc50	3	The effect of impaired functioning on QoL was partially mediated by participation in children with greater dependency in managing personal needs and those with mildly impaired communication.
doc50	4	Greater levels of impairments with poorer functioning, notably a high level of dependence, were associated with poorer QoL. Poorer QoL can be partly explained by less frequent community participation.
doc52	1	Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disease caused by a primary defect in the LDL-receptor gene.
doc52	2	Distinct variants in the same gene characterize a compound heterozygote, but little is known about the phenotypes of the carriers.
doc52	3	Therefore, herein, we describe the cascade screening of a Brazilian family with this characteristic.
doc52	4	The index case, a 36-year-old male, had a total cholesterol level of 360 mg/dL (9.3 mmol/L) and LDL-c value of 259 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L), in addition to Achilles tendon xanthomas, obesity and prehypertension.
doc52	5	Genotyping identified the variants 661G>A, 670G>A, 682G>A in exon 4 and 919G>A in exon 6.
doc52	6	The same variant in exon 4 was found in the index case's son (7-y), who also had hypercholesterolemia and xanthomas, while the index case's daughter (9-y) had the variant in exon 6 and hyperlipidemia, without xanthomas.

doc54	4	To evaluate the in vivo hypotensive effect of manool and check the ex vivo vasorelaxation effect in rat aortic rings.
doc54	5	The animals were divided randomly into two groups: normotensive and hypertensive.
doc54	6	The normotensive group was sham-operated, and the 2K1C model was adopted for the hypertensive group.
doc54	7	Invasive BP monitoring was performed for manool tests at different doses (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg).
doc54	8	Concentration-response curves for manool were obtained in the aorta rings, with endothelium, pre-contracted with phenylephrine (Phe) after incubation with Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester(L-NAME) or oxadiazole [4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ).
doc54	9	Nitric oxide (NOx) plasma levels were measured by chemiluminescence assay.
doc54	10	After manool administration, BP was reduced in normotensive and hypertensive groups, and this effect was inhibited by L-NAME in hypertensive animals only in 10 mg/kg dose.
doc54	11	Ex vivo manool promoted vasorelaxation, which was inhibited by L-NAME and ODQ incubation or endothelium removal.
doc54	12	NOx plasma levels increased in the hypertensive group after manool administration.
doc54	13	Manool elicits endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation in rat aorta mediated by the NO/cGMP signaling pathway and BP reduction, also by NOx plasma increase.

doc58	6	Data were analyzed using SPSS Version 24.0.
doc58	7	The significance level was set at p<0.05.
doc58	8	Of the 330 respondents, 89% of women and 70% of men experienced stress.
doc58	9	The female gender was associated with nearly threefold higher odds of experiencing stress (EXP (B)2.79, p = 0.02).
doc58	10	Regarding the phases of stress, women were more often in the near-exhaustion and exhaustion phases, while men were more often in the resistance phase.
doc58	11	This study showed that women are most often in the third and fourth phases of stress, i.e., in situations of long-standing psychosocial stress.
doc58	12	These findings can assist in the development of gender-specific strategies for health promotion and disease prevention, aiming to minimize the effects of stress in this population.

doc6	1	This study aimed to measure the occurrence of multimorbidity and to estimate the number of individuals in the Brazilian population 50 years or older at risk for severe COVID-19.
doc6	2	This was a cross-sectional nationwide study based on data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), conducted in 2015-2016, with 9,412 individuals 50 years or older.
doc6	3	Multimorbidity was defined as ≥ 2 chronic conditions based on a list of 15 diseases considered risk conditions for severe COVID-19.
doc6	4	The analyses included calculation of prevalence and estimation of the absolute number of persons in the population at risk.
doc6	5	Self-rated health status, frailty, and basic activities of daily living were used as markers of health status.
doc6	6	Sex, age, region of the country, and schooling were used as covariables.
doc6	7	Some 80% of the sample had at least one of the target conditions, which represents some 34 million individuals.
doc6	8	Multimorbidity was reported by 52% of the study population, with higher proportions in the Central, Southeast, and South of Brazil.
doc6	9	Cardiovascular diseases and obesity were the most frequent chronic conditions.
doc6	10	An estimated 2.4 million Brazilians are at serious health risk.
doc6	11	The results revealed inequalities according to schooling.
doc6	12	The number of persons 50 years or older who presented risk conditions for severe COVID-19 is high both in absolute and relative terms.

doc60	1	The article analyzes actions in the prevention and control of overweight and obesity that have been developed in the 92 municipalities (counties) in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, based on underlying principles in the typology of public policies developed by Lowi and Line of Care for Overweight and Obesity, according to the following analytical dimensions: program actions in prevention and control of obesity, characterization of macro policies according to the Lowi typology, and characterization of macro policies according to the Line of Care for Overweight and Obesity.
doc60	2	The study is part of a research project from 2014 to 2018 that aimed to identify the strategies and challenges in the consolidation of the actions planned in the Line of Care for Overweight and Obesity, based on analysis of secondary data and government documents; searches in the municipalities' official websites; interviews; focus groups; and online questionnaires with health professionals and managers.
doc60	3	The documents point to a series of actions such as individual consultations, support groups, health gyms, school health programs, and others, reinforced by the interviewees' narratives.
doc60	4	Even with so many initiatives, the municipalities in the state of Rio de Janeiro face challenges with limited human resources and precarious infrastructure and equipment in the health units.
doc60	5	To achieve mobilization in the actions to deal with obesity, the issue should be addressed specifically on the state and local agendas and not diluted among other activities and programs.
doc61	1	Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is common in older adults, who also present a high level of risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as dyslipidemia.
doc61	2	However, the role of depression in T2DM patients and its relationship with CVD risk factors are understudied.
doc61	3	The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between depressive symptoms (DS) and known cardiovascular risk factors in community dwelling older adults with T2DM.
doc61	4	This is a cross sectional study, in which 85 community-dwelling older adults with T2DM were assessed.
doc61	5	DS was assessed using the Yesavage Geriatric Depression Scale - short version (GDS-15).
doc61	6	The following cardiovascular risk factors were evaluated: systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), lipid profile (serum triglycerides - TG, serum total cholesterol - TC, serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol - LDL-C, and serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol - HDL-C) and body mass index (BMI).
doc61	7	Poisson multiple regression was performed to test the association between DS and each cardiovascular risk factor adjusted by sex, age, time spent in moderate physical activity, and functional status.
doc61	8	The significance level adopted for the analysis was 5%.

doc62	1	The study aimed to compare two concepts of rurality, one proposed by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) and the other by the World Bank, to determine which is better fitted to the territory's reality, besides analyzing the infant mortality profile of rural municipalities (counties) in the state of Paraíba, Brazil, according to the best criterion for rurality.
doc62	2	This was an observational epidemiological study conducted in the state of Paraíba.
doc62	3	The method for analyzing rural/urban typologies was based on data mining, using the Apriori algorithm of association.
doc62	4	Infant mortality was analyzed with descriptive statistics.
doc62	5	The data were obtained from the Mortality Information System of the Brazilian Ministry of Health, from 2007 to 2016, and municipal indicators were from IBGE.
doc62	6	The World Bank definition of rurality showed kappa = 0.337, compared to the IBGE definition, with kappa = 0.616. Among the 223 municipalities that were analyzed, the World Bank classified 130 (65.66%) correctly, and the IBGE 183 (82.06%).
doc62	7	The predominant epidemiological profile of infant mortality in rural municipalities in Paraiba state was male gender (57.4%), brown skin color (61.1%), age from 0 to 7 days (52.4%), low birthweight (44%), and gestational age less than 37 weeks (43.2%).
doc62	8	Underlying cause of death was classified as avoidable death via interventions by the Brazilian Unified National Health System (65.2%).
doc62	9	The urban/rural typology adopted by the IBGE was better than the World Bank at classifying the municipalities in Paraiba state.
doc62	10	This classification allowed studying the infant mortality profile in rural municipalities, which was similar to the overall profile, except for maternal schooling.
doc64	1	The timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic began on December 31, 2019, in China, with SARS-CoV-2 identified as the etiological agent.
doc64	2	This article aims to describe the COVID-19 epidemic's spatial and temporal dynamics in the first hundred days in the State of Pernambuco, Brazil.
doc64	3	We present the evolution in cases and deaths according to epidemiological weeks.
doc64	4	We analyzed the series of accumulated daily confirmed COVID-19 cases, with projections for the subsequent 15 days, using the JoinPoint app.
doc64	5	This software allows identifying turning points, testing their statistical significance.
doc64	6	We also analyze the trend in the spread of COVID-19 to the interior of the state, considering the percent distribution of cases in the state capital, Recife, municipalities in Greater Metropolitan Recife, and the state's interior, by sets of three weeks, constructing thematic maps.
doc64	7	The first hundred days of the COVID-19 epidemic resulted in 52,213 cases and 4,235 deaths from March 12, or epidemiological week 11, until June 20, 2020 (epidemiological week 25).
doc64	8	The peak in the epidemic curve occurred in epidemiological week 21 (May 23), followed by deceleration in the number of cases.
doc64	9	We initially detected the spread of cases from the city center to the periphery of the state capital and Metropolitan Area, followed by rapid spread to the state's interior.
doc64	10	There was a decrease in the mean daily growth starting in April, but with an average threshold of more than 6,000 weekly cases of COVID-19.
doc64	11	At the end of the period, the state's case series indicates the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 circulation and community transmission.
doc64	12	Finally, paraphrasing Gabriel Garcia Marques in One Hundred Years of Solitude, we ask whether we are facing "a pause in the storm or a sign of redoubled rain".
doc66	1	This essay discusses the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic on the relation between labor and health, from the perspective of the workers' risk and vulnerability.
doc66	2	The pandemic has represented a humanitarian crisis, since both the disease and the measures to contain it lead to persistent socioeconomic effects.
doc66	3	In this context, the labor category has an important role, either because of the feasibility of maintaining the social distancing and living conditions allowed by the employment relationship, or because of the impossibility of adopting protection strategies due to job insecurity.
doc66	4	The essay was initially built on the basis of a literature review on the interface between COVID-19 and workers' health, carried out from December 2019 to April 2020, on the PubMed, BIREME, Cochrane Library, medRxiv and LitCovid bases, as well as using gray literature.
doc66	5	Health professionals are more affected, but they also have greater access to diagnosis; however, data are still scarce on other professional categories, as well as on the social determinants that lead to greater labor-related vulnerability.
doc66	6	In Brazil, the pandemic coincides with a situation in which workers accumulate significant losses of labor and social security rights, in addition to pre-existing social inequalities, such as precarious housing, with greater exposure and risk.
doc66	7	Although the pandemic is still evolving, social inequalities are expected to intensify, with the deep retraction of the economy, and workers must be a priority target of attention in the control and spread of the disease, in addition to being the axis for planning public social and health protection policies.
doc68	1	To describe leisure participation in adolescents with congenital heart defects (CHD) and identify factors associated with intensity of participation.
doc68	2	Eighty adolescents with CHD were recruited (39 males, 41 females; mean age [SD] 15y 8mo [1y 8mo] range 11y 5mo-19y 11mo) of whom 78 completed the Children's Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment (CAPE) outcome measure of leisure participation.
doc68	3	The measure has five subscales: recreational, active-physical, social, skill-based, and self-improvement.
doc68	4	Associations between the CAPE and age, sex, and development were examined.
doc68	5	Motor ability (Movement Assessment Battery for Children, Second Edition), cognition (Leiter International Performance Scale-Revised), behavior (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), and motivation (Dimensions of Mastery Questionnaire) were assessed.
doc68	6	Participants exhibited impaired motor (43.5%), behavioral (23.7%), and cognitive (29.9%) development.
doc68	7	The most intense participation was in social (mean [SD] 3.3 [0.99]) and recreational (2.9 [0.80]) activity types on the CAPE.
doc68	8	Male sex (p<0.05) and younger age were associated with greater physical activity (<15y: 1.87; ≥15y: 1.31, p<0.05).
doc68	9	Greater engagement in social activities was related to better cognition (r=0.28, p<0.05), higher motor function (r=0.30-0.36, p<0.01), and fewer behavioral difficulties (r=-0.32 to -0.47, p<0.01).
doc68	10	Cognitive ability (r=0.27, p<0.05), dexterity and aiming/catching (r=0.27-0.33, p<0.05), and behavior problems (r=0.38-0.49, p=0.001) were correlated with physical activity participation.
doc68	11	Persistence in tasks, an aspect of motivation, correlated with physical (r=0.45, p<0.001) and social activity involvement (r=0.28, p<0.05).
doc68	12	Ongoing developmental impairments in adolescents with CHD are associated with decreased active-physical and social engagement, putting them at risk of poor physical and mental health.
doc68	13	Health promotion strategies should be considered.
doc68	14	Adolescents with congenital heart defects (CHD) have limited engagement in active-physical leisure activities.
doc68	15	Cognitive, motor, and behavioral impairments are associated with decreased participation in leisure in children with CHD.

doc7	1	The aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with sex practice under the effect of drugs (chemsex) among men who have sex with men (MSM) during the period of social isolation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
doc7	2	A multicenter online survey was applied to Brazil and Portugal in April 2020 when the two countries were under restrictive health measures due to the pandemic.
doc7	3	Participants were recruited with an adaptation of the respondent driven sampling (RDS) method in the online environment.
doc7	4	Data were collected using social networks and dating apps for MSM.
doc7	5	We used bivariate and multivariate logistic regression to produce crude (OR) and adjusted odds ratios (aOR).
doc7	6	In a universe of 2,361 subjects, 920 (38.9%) reported engaging in chemsex practice, which involved casual partners in 95% of the cases.
doc7	7	Higher OR of engaging in chemsex were associated with Brazil (aOR = 15.4; 95%CI: 10.7-22.1), not being in social isolation (aOR = 4.9; 95%CI: 2.2-10.9), engaging in casual sex during social distancing (aOR = 52.4; 95%CI: 33.8-81.4), group sex (aOR = 2.9; 95%CI: 2.0-4.4), not presenting any symptom of COVID-19 (aOR = 1.3; 95%CI: 1.1-1.8), not living with the sex partner (aOR = 1.8; 95%CI: 1.2-2.6), and using pre-exposure prophylaxis (aOR = 2.6; 95%CI: 1.8-3.7).
doc7	8	The occurrence of chemsex was high, especially in Brazil, where the proposed social distancing did not gain adherence by MSM.

doc74	5	We compared overall survival, progression-free survival, the incidence of nonrelapse mortality and relapse in 10-year cohorts over the three decades of the study.
doc74	6	The median age of transplanted patients, the use of peripheral blood and unrelated donors all increased very significantly.
doc74	7	There was an increase in the number of high-risk patients when comparing the first decade with the two subsequent ones.
doc74	8	The 3-year non-relapse mortality decreased significantly from 29% to 20% (p = 0.045), while the overall survival, progression free survival and cumulative incidence of relapse remained stable.
doc74	9	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has evolved considerably since its introduction in clinical practice.
doc74	10	In the present study, we evaluated how these changes affected our practice along 30 years of activity and compared the results with those published in the literature.
doc74	11	Despite increasing age, higher risk patients and the increasing use of unrelated donors our results show a continuous significantly reduced non-relapse mortality, with stable overall survival, progression free survival and relapse rate.
doc75	1	Equity is a central goal of health policy in Portugal.
doc75	2	However, empirical evidence regarding healthcare usage is scarce and there is a lack of up-to-date results.
doc75	3	Our objective is to evaluate whether the principle of equal utilisation for equal need has been met.
doc75	4	We use data from the National Health Survey 2014.
doc75	5	Healthcare usage is measured by the number of visits to a Family Physician or to a hospital-based specialist.
doc75	6	To assess the factors affecting usage we adopted a multivariate regression analysis (Negative Binomial Model).
doc75	7	To quantify income-related inequality/inequity in utilisation we computed the concentration index.
doc75	8	Better self-assessed health and absence of limitations in daily activities decrease usage; suffering from chronic disease increases usage.
doc75	9	Income is not statistically significant; education positively affects usage with a pronounced effect.
doc75	10	Living in urban areas increases usage as well as living in Lisbon (compared to North).
doc75	11	Living in Algarve or Madeira, or benefiting only from the National Health Service coverage negatively affects usage.
doc75	12	The possibility for equity in Family Physician visits cannot be discarded.
doc75	13	Regarding hospital based specialist and total visits, the evidence suggests the existence of pro-rich inequity.
doc75	14	The observed income-related inequity seems to reflect inequalities in other non-need variables.
doc75	15	Whether the results are affected by overuse, in the case of hospital based specialist visits, is an issue open to question.
doc75	16	Portugal evolved favourably in terms of equity in healthcare usage but several challenges remain.
doc76	1	To verify the association among overweight, obesity and high blood pressure in Brazilian students aged between 6 and 10 years old.
doc76	2	Cross-sectional study carried out in the city of Macaé, RJ, in which body mass, height and blood pressure were collected.
doc76	3	The body mass index was calculated using the Anthro Plus software and classified according to SISVAN.
doc76	4	High systolic/diastolic blood pressure when ≥ 90th percentile by age, gender and height/age percentile (7th Brazilian Guideline on Hypertension).
doc76	5	Logistic regression with a 95% confidence interval, using SPSS software were done.
doc76	6	A total of 911 children were evaluated and, after stratification by nutritional status, the underweight were excluded.
doc76	7	Among the remaining 888 children, the prevalence of overweight was 17.7% and obesity 16.2%.
doc76	8	The prevalence of high blood pressure was 34%, with no statistical difference between gender (p=0.57).
doc76	9	Overweight was significantly associated with high blood pressure in the 8-9 year old group (OR 1.99; p=004), while obesity was associated in both groups (6-7 year old OR 2.50; p=0.004 and 8-9 year old OR 4.21 p=0.001).
doc76	10	The results showed that overweight and obesity significantly increased the chance of high blood pressure among children aged 6 to 10 years old.
doc78	1	This study aimed to describe the estimated means for weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) according to two imputation methods, using data from Vigitel (Risk and Protective Factors Surveillance System for Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases Through Telephone Interview).
doc78	2	This was a cross-sectional study that used secondary data from the Vigitel survey from 2006 to 2017.
doc78	3	The two imputation methods used in the study were hot deck and Predictive Mean Matching (PMM).
doc78	4	The weight and height variables imputed by hot deck were provided by Vigitel.
doc78	5	Two models were conducted with PMM: (i) explanatory variables - city, sex, age in years, race/color, and schooling; (ii) explanatory variables - city, sex, and age in years.
doc78	6	Weight and height were the outcome variables in the two models.
doc78	7	PMM combines linear regression and random selection of the value for imputation.
doc78	8	Linear prediction is used as a measure of distance between the missing value and the possible donors, thereby creating the virtual space with the candidate cases for yielding the value for imputation.
doc78	9	One of the candidates from the pool is randomly selected, and its value is assigned to the missing unit.
doc78	10	BMI was calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height squared.
doc78	11	The result shows the means and standard deviations for weight, height, and BMI according to imputation method and year.
doc78	12	The estimates used the survey module from Stata, which considers the sampling effects.
doc78	13	The mean values for weight, height, and BMI estimated by hot deck and PMM were similar.
doc78	14	The results with the Vigitel data suggest the applicability of PMM to the set of health surveys.
doc79	1	Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is considered one of the most frequent behavioral and neurodevelopmental problems in school-age children and adolescents, both in Portugal and worldwide.
doc79	2	The diagnostic categorization of ADHD and the prescription of psychostimulants as its first-line treatment have been the object not only of scientific research and clinical validation, but also of controversy and social critique, especially in light of the concept of medicalization.
doc79	3	Despite its high profile and salience in such diverse fields as education, pharmaceuticals, mental health, and public policy, a significant gap remains in the characterization of social-historical, ethical, and institutional dimensions of ADHD outside English-speaking countries.
doc79	4	Combining historical and ethnographic research with document and media analysis, the article addresses that challenge by tracing the social trajectory of ADHD in Portugal, from the emergence of "hyperactivity" in the 1970s and 1980s to the current public and political debates on psychostimulant treatments and prescribing trends.
doc79	5	From this interdisciplinary perspective and based on the Portuguese case study, the aim of this article is to contextualize the definition, validation, and expansion of ADHD as part of a dynamic and socially situated process in which global diagnostic and pharmaceutical systems intersect with institutional and socioeconomic contingencies, as well as local specificities and needs.
doc79	6	More broadly, the article discusses how the case study of ADHD contributes to the development of interdisciplinary research that helps rethinking the social scope of mental health across local and global health contexts.
doc8	1	To compare the postoperative outcomes of transforaminal intersomatic lumbar arthrodesis with structured iliac bone autograft and PEEK device.
doc8	2	The total of 93 medical records of patients undergoing transforaminal intersomatic fusion between January 2012 and July 2017 with at least 1 year of postoperative follow-up, with complete medical record, containing clinical file and radiological exams, were reviewed.
doc8	3	From the medical records evaluated, 48 patients underwent the procedure with structured iliac autograft (group 1) and 45 with PEEK device (group 2).
doc8	4	There was an improvement in functional capacity in both groups (p < 0.001), however there was no difference when comparing them (p = 0.591).
doc8	5	The postoperative clinical and radiological results of lumbar arthrodesis with TLIF technique, using a structured iliac bone autograft compared to a PEEK device, were similar.
doc80	1	Data on the management and prognosis of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and multivessel disease are limited in Brazil, showing that the available revascularization strategies should be investigated.
doc80	2	To assess the outcomes of complete revascularization versus treatment of the culprit artery only in patients with STEMI and multivessel disease.
doc80	3	A prospective cohort study was conducted at two medical centers in southern Brazil with a 1-year follow-up after the index procedure.
doc80	4	The primary outcome was a composite of cardiac death, reinfarction, or recurrent angina, while the secondary outcome was stroke, nonfatal cardiac arrest, major bleeding, or need for reintervention.
doc80	5	The probability of outcomes occurring was compared between the groups using binary logistic regression.
doc80	6	A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
doc80	7	Eighty-five patients were included.
doc80	8	Their mean age was 62±12 years, and 61 (71.8%) were male.
doc80	9	Fifty-eight (68.2%) were treated with complete revascularization and 27 (31.8%) with incomplete revascularization.
doc80	10	The chance of both the primary and secondary outcomes occurring was significantly greater among patients treated with incomplete revascularization when compared to those treated with complete revascularization (odds ratio [OR] 5.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-16.1 vs. OR 5.2, 95% CI 1.2-22.9, respectively), as well as cardiac death (OR 6.4, 95% CI 1.2-35.3).
doc80	11	Registry data from two centers in southern Brazil demonstrate that the complete revascularization strategy is associated with a significant reduction in primary and secondary outcomes in a 1-year follow-up when compared to the incomplete revascularization strategy (Arq Bras Cardiol. 2020; 115(2):229-237).
doc83	1	Low-dose edoxaban and enoxaparin sodium have been the subject of a retrospective comparison implemented with the propensity score technique in order to mitigate the effects of the differences in the basal clinical features of two cohorts and minimize the risk of bias.
doc83	2	Subsequently, using a Cox proportional-hazards model, the association of each type of therapy with the risk of the composite of all-cause death, stroke/transient ischemic attack, hospitalizations and major bleeding events was assessed.
doc83	3	For this analysis, a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
doc83	4	Therapy with enoxaparin and liver cirrhosis as causing thrombocytopenia were associated with increased risk of the composite endpoint (enoxaparin: hazard ratio (HR): 3.31; 95% CI: 1.54 to 7.13; p = 0.0023; liver cirrhosis, HR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.002 to 1.089; p = 0.0410).
doc83	5	Conversely, edoxaban therapy was significantly associated with decreased risk of the composite endpoint (HR: 0.071; 95% CI: 0.013 to 0.373; p = 0.0019).
doc83	6	Based on this retrospective analysis, edoxaban at low doses would appear as an effective and safe pharmacological tool for the prophylaxis of cardioembolic events in patients with AF and thrombocytopenia.
doc84	1	Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) can reduce mortality among patients with aortic stenosis.
doc84	2	Knowledge of pressure distribution and shear stress at the aortic wall may help identify critical regions, where aortic remodeling process may occur.
doc84	3	Here a numerical simulation study of the influence of positioning of the prosthetic valve orifice on the flow field is presented.
doc84	4	The present analysis provides a perspective of great variance on flow behavior due only to angle changes.
doc84	5	A 3D model was generated from computed tomography angiography of a patient who had undergone a TAVR.
doc84	6	Different mass flow rates were imposed at the inlet valve.
doc84	7	Small variations of the tilt angle could modify the nature of the flow, displacing the position of the vortices, and altering the prerssure distribution and the location of high wall shear stress.
doc84	8	These hemodynamic features may be relevant in the aortic remodeling process and distribution of the stress mapping and could help, in the near future, the optimization of the percutaneous prosthesis implantation.

doc85	1	The conditions affecting the calcaneal tendon remain extremely prevalent in the clinical practice.
doc85	2	The search for information about these diseases in national and international scientific databases are commonly hampered in the use of search tools, requiring the use if an eponym in the strategy.
doc85	3	Achilles, in reference to the hero of the Greek mythology, is often used by several authors in scientific publications despite the new Nomina Anatomica.

doc87	2	Volar plate fixation is not always considered the gold standard treatment.
doc87	3	To measure the resistance of a fragment-specific fixation assembly model obtained by plate fixation associated with different K-wire sizes.
doc87	4	In this original experimental study, novel II, axial compression of bone materials was tested.
doc87	5	In both groups, the maximum force supported by the fixation method in our study was ten times greater than the physiological load to which the wrist was subjected under physiological conditions.
doc87	6	In this study, we obtained encouraging results when compared to results reported in the literature.
doc87	7	Our study showed that our bone fixating system was mechanically adequate for articular fractures of the intermediate column of the radius (Melone classification).
doc87	8	The results were similar or superior to the results of pressure resistance and stiffness when data from the literature was used as reference.
doc87	9	The proposed fixation method demonstrated adequate resistance for fixation of the intermediate column of the distal radius.
doc87	10	Increasing K wire size caused augmented resistance of the fixation.
