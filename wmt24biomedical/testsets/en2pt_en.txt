to measure urinary volume through bladder ultrasound, performed by a nurse in critically ill patients, after removal of the indwelling urinary catheter and to verify the related factors on urinary retention. quantitative, observational and cross-sectional study, carried out with 37 critically ill patients of both sexes, over 18 years of age, with removal of indwelling urinary catheter in the last 48 hours. A questionnaire containing sociodemographic and clinical variables and an ultrasound examination were used. Data were presented through frequency distribution, centrality and variability measures, association using Fisher`s exact test and, for analysis multiple binomial logistic regression analysis. the 37 patients were mostly male, with a mean age of 54.9 years. The measurement of urinary volume by ultrasound ranged from 332.3 to 950 ml, and 40.54% of patients had urinary retention. Urinary retention was significantly associated with the occurrence of urinary tract infection, intestinal constipation and spontaneous overflow diuresis. Patients with urinary tract infection were 7.4 times more likely to have urinary retention. bladder ultrasonography was effective in measuring urinary volume after removal of the indwelling urinary catheter and and may contribute to the detection of urinary retention. (1) Ultrasonography of the bladder showed an advantage for a better nursing diagnosis. (2) Critical patients had urinary retention after removal of urinary catheter. (3) Overflow incontinence was detected after removal of the urinary catheter. (4) Patients with urinary tract infection were 7.4 times more likely to have retention.
In this integrative review, we aimed to describe the records of time devoted by physicians to breast ultrasound in a review of articles in the literature, in order to observe whether the automation of the method enabled a reduction in these values. We selected articles from the Latin American and Caribbean Literature in Health Sciences (LILACS) and MEDLINE databases, through Virtual Health Library (BVS), SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online), PubMed, and Scopus. We obtained 561 articles, and, after excluding duplicates and screening procedures, 9 were selected, whose main information related to the guiding question of the research was synthesized and analyzed. It was concluded that the automation of breast ultrasound represents a possible strategy for optimization of the medical time dedicated to the method, but this needs to be better evaluated in comparative studies between both methods (traditional and automated), with methodology directed to the specific investigation of this potentiality.
To develop a guide for the preparation of speech-language reports of implanted children to be shared among speech-language pathologists of cochlear implant (CI) services and rehabilitation professionals. The Delphi method was used to select the relevant and fundamental items that should be included in the two versions proposed for the guide: Guide 1 - Speech-language reports provided by the CI services to rehabilitators, and Guide 2 - Speech-language reports provided by the rehabilitators to CI services. Twenty-one speech therapists specialized and with experience in cochlear implants and auditory rehabilitation participated in the discussion and judgment of the items during the selection rounds. Consensus was considered when the item reached agreement equal to or greater than 80% among participants, being selected to compose the two guides. After the two rounds, 21 items from Guide 1 reached consensus among therapists, that is, more than 80% of them agreed that these items should be present in the report sent by the CI service. For Guide 2, 22 items analyzed by speech therapists working in CI services in the postoperative sector were selected in the second round. Based on the analysis of the two rounds, the "Guide for the preparation of speech-language pathology reports: intersection between CI service and rehabilitators" was developed. This material can be applied in the follow-up of implanted children, standardizing the information shared about the electronic device, evaluation results, monitoring of results and therapeutic process of this population.
Ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is the fourth most common cancer-associated cause of death in the Western world. The presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be considered a potential prognostic factor, as these cells represent tumor progression, allowing monitoring of therapeutic efficacy. The objectives of this study were to explore the morphological, molecular, and phenotypic characteristics of CTCs from the blood of patients with pancreatic carcinoma and to correlate the findings with response to treatment, progression-free survival, overall survival (OS), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Peripheral blood (10 mL) was analyzed before the beginning of treatment after 60 and 120 days. CTCs were detected by using ISET® and characterized by immunocytochemistry. For microRNAs (miRNAs) analysis, peripheral leukocytes from the same patients and healthy individuals (controls) were collected in parallel at baseline. The expression of miRNAs was evaluated (in pool) using TaqMan® Array Human MicroRNA Cards v2.0. Only nine patients were included. The proteins, namely, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) and TGFβ-RI, were highly expressed (77.7%) in CTCs at baseline; at the first follow-up, MMP2 was predominant (80%) and, at the second follow-up, MMP2 and vimentin were predominant (50%). Circulating tumor microemboli (CTMs) were found in two patients and both presented DVT. The miR-203a-3p was highly expressed in CTCs. The miR-203a-3p is involved in the stimulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and is related to worse OS in pancreatic cancer (TCGA data). Due to the low number of patients and short follow-up, we did not observe a correlation between CTCs and response to treatment. However, there was a correlation between CTM and DVT and also miR-203a-3p was highly expressed in CTCs, corroborating the findings of EMT proteins. This study opens the perspectives concerning the dynamic change in the pattern of proteins expressed along with treatment and the use of miRNAs as new targets in pancreatic carcinoma.
Patients with epilepsy (PWE) frequently have comorbid psychiatric disorders, the most common of which are depression and anxiety. Attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADHD) is also more frequent among PWE, though that condition has been scarcely studied among the adult PWE population.  This study aimed to compare the presence of ADHD symptoms between adult PWE and the general population.  This was an observational case-control study. Ninety-five adult PWE from a tertiary center in southern Brazil were compared with 100 healthy controls. All subjects were submitted to three structured scales: 1) the World Health Organization Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale version 1.1 (ASRS); 2) the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); and 3) the Adverse Events Profile (AEP). Dichotomic variables were analyzed through chi-square test and Fisher's exact test, as appropriate, and non-parametric variables were analyzed through the Mann-Whitney   Medians and interquartile ranges (IR) were: 1) ASRS: 26.00 (IR: 18 to 38) among PWE versus 17.00 (IR: 11 to 24) among controls,   PWE showed a higher burden of symptoms of ADHD, depression, and anxiety when compared with controls, which replicates in the Brazilian population the findings of current literature that point toward a higher prevalence of such disorders among PWE.
To obtain a comprehensive overview of organ donation, organ utilization, and discard in the entire donation process in Colombia. A retrospective study of 1 451 possible donors, distributed in three regions of Colombia, evaluated in 2022. The general characteristics, diagnosis, and causes of contraindication for potential donors were described. Among the 1 451 possible donors, 441 (30.4%) fulfilled brain death criteria, constituting the potential dono About one-tenth of donors are effectively used for transplantation purposes. Our findings highlight areas of success and challenges, providing a basis for future improvements in Colombia.
Post-anaesthetic fever is a known complication of general anaesthesia, however, its incidence in horses undergoing elective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is unknown. To determine the incidence of post-anaesthetic fever in horses undergoing elective orthopaedic MRI and determine whether prophylactic antimicrobial therapy would be associated with a reduction in the incidence of post-anaesthetic fever. We hypothesised that prophylactic antimicrobials would be associated with a reduction in the incidence of post-anaesthetic fever. Retrospective cross-sectional study. This retrospective study included 791 elective orthopaedic MRIs in systemically healthy horses between June 2006 and March 2020 that recovered from general anaesthesia and did not undergo surgery or intensive medical therapy soon after recovery. Potential factors associated with post-anaesthetic fever were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. Case signalment, travel time, preanaesthetic haematology and fibrinogen abnormalities, use of prophylactic antimicrobials, peri-anaesthetic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, anaesthesia time and recovery time were all evaluated for association with post-anaesthetic fever. Of 791 MRI cases, 44 (5.6%) developed a post-anaesthetic fever. Horses that received prophylactic antimicrobials were [odds ratio (OR) 3.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.98-7.46; p ≤ 0.001] more likely to develop a post-anaesthetic fever than those that did not receive antimicrobials. Young horses (1-4 years of age) were (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.26-6.17; p = 0.01) more likely to develop fever compared with adult horses (≥5 years of age). Limitations of this study pertain to retrospective analysis including nonrandomised case selection and incomplete data records. While fever may indicate infection, the majority of early post-anaesthetic fevers resolved before discharge from the hospital with no identified cause. The use of prophylactic antimicrobials to reduce the risk of post-anaesthetic fever for elective MRI is not supported by this study.
A two-year-old Pomeranian dog with Alopecia X was cloned after accidental death. Despite earlier castration, the cloned animal developed the same lesions of Alopecia X at the same age. This observation suggests that the disease is due to genetically programmed hair cycle arrest without strong environmental influences.
We quilombola women, a documentary that considers the quilombola identity and the right to COVID-19 vaccination, evokes notions of priority, rights, privileges and identity during the process of matching the number of vaccine doses available to citizens' arms. Omission by a Brazilian federal government grounded in necro-politics and denial, plus a lack of information, led quilombo communities to take it on themselves to draw up lists of those eligible for vaccination. The production team's aim was to use images as political language in the health field, so as to document and give visibility to these issues as one illustration of combating social and health inequalities and inequities rooted in structural racism. By combining science and art and interlacing references from the sociology of images, visual anthropology, plus the work and aesthetic devices of Eduardo Coutinho, the audiovisual production method brought out three key categories: I, We, and They, quilombola women. This article explores these categories underpinning construction of the documentary narrative, which drew on the potential of images, which in turn served as anti-racist, political and educational devices, both in the course of the production process and during the public screenings.
Primary cutaneous lymphoma represents 0.2%-3% of all feline lymphomas, with nonepitheliotropic lymphomas being the most common. In humans and dogs, subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) is a primary nonepitheliotropic lymphoma with a T-cell phenotype developing in the subcutis and often mimicking inflammation. The aim of this report is to describe pathological, phenotypical and clonal features of SPTCL in cats. Six cats with SPTCL were included in this study. Skin biopsies were formalin-fixed, routinely processed and stained. Histological and immunohistochemical investigation for anti-CD18, CD204, CD79a, CD20, CD3, FeLVp27and FeLVgp70 and clonality assessment were performed. Four male and two female domestic shorthair cats, mean age 11.2 years, developed SPTCL in the abdominal (three), inguinal (two) and thoracic (one) regions. Variably pleomorphic neoplastic lymphoid cells were present in the panniculus in percentages, expanding the septa (six of six) and extending into fat lobules in one of six cats. Tumours were associated with elevated numbers of neutrophils (five of six), lesser macrophages (six of six) and variable necrosis (six of six). Neoplastic cells expressed CD3 This is the first description of SPTCL in cats. Lesions can be confused with panniculitis, leading to delay in diagnosis and therapy. Awareness of this neoplastic disease is relevant to avoid misdiagnoses and to gain greater knowledge about the disease in cats.
The collection of clinical data is an essential step for the development of any scientific research. Online digital data collection can optimize this step. To compare the response rate and the accuracy of the clinical data collection date through the online and physical digital questionnaire in orthopedic patients. Comparative study, level III of evidence, with forty patients who had ankle sprains were evaluated, followed up for a period of 12 weeks with the application of physical and digital Visual Analogue Scale, Foot Function Index and Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool questionnaires, and data were collected about the moment of collection of each questionnaire. We obtained a response rate of 83.3% in the digital collection group and 60% in the physical collection group (p < 0.05), and the response rate in the digital collection group was higher at all times of collection (3, 6 and 12 weeks). Analysis of the time of collection shows greater variability in the larger physical collection group at all times of the study (2.8 vs 1.5; 4.0 vs 2.4; 8.6 vs 1.5). Digital data collection is effective for obtaining clinical data in patients with ankle sprains.
Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is an atypical parkinsonian syndrome of great interest to movement disorder specialists and behavioral neurologists. Although originally considered a primary motor disorder, it is now also recognized as a cognitive disorder, usually presenting cognitive deficits before the onset of motor symptoms. The term CBS denotes the clinical phenotype and is associated with a heterogeneous spectrum of pathologies. Given that disease-modifying agents are targeting the pathologic process, new diagnostic methods and biomarkers are being developed to predict the underlying pathology. The heterogeneity of this syndrome in terms of clinical, radiological, neuropsychological and pathological aspects poses the main challenge for evaluation.
To determine whether being a smoker and the years of smoking correlate with the presence and degree of meniscal injury. Individuals who underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the knee were divided into two groups: smokers and nonsmokers. For each smoker, the total smoking history was calculated by multiplying the daily consumption (packs/day) by the years of smoking, and the result is expressed as pack-years. In the evaluation of meniscal injury, the grade of injury was recorded. The thickness of the subcutaneous adipose tissue, as an indicator of obesity, was measured at the medial knee on axial plane images. The relationships that smoking and obesity had with meniscal injury were analyzed statistically. A total of 156 individuals were included in the study. The smoker group consisted of 48 individuals (30.8%), and the nonsmoker group consisted of 108 (69.2%). The meniscus was normal in one (2.1%) of the smokers and in 32 (29.6%) of the nonsmokers ( Our findings indicate that current smoking and smoking history correlate significantly with meniscal injury grade.
Central Illustration : Position Statement on the Use of Myocardial Strain in Cardiology Routines by the Brazilian Society of Cardiology's Department Of Cardiovascular Imaging - 2023 Proposal for including strain in the integrated diastolic function assessment algorithm, adapted from Nagueh et al.67 Am: mitral A-wave duration; Ap: reverse pulmonary A-wave duration; DD: diastolic dysfunction; LA: left atrium; LASr: LA strain reserve; LVGLS: left ventricular global longitudinal strain; TI: tricuspid insufficiency.

This algorithm does not apply to patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), mitral annulus calcification, > mild mitral valve disease, left bundle branch block, paced rhythm, prosthetic valves, or severe primary pulmonary hypertension.
Costs with dementia have been the focus of research around the world and indirect costs to the caregiver appear in the literature as responsible for the greatest impact. In Latin American (LA) studies, indirect costs with dementia range from 60% to 75% of family income. To present preliminary results of the study "Description of the methods and cost analysis with dementia" currently being conducted at the Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology Unit of Hospital de Clínicas of University of São Paulo - HC-FMUSP. A cross-sectional study which, to date, includes interviews of 93 primary caregivers. The research protocol includes a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) scale, the Burden Interview (Zarit), an economic classification scale, and the Resource Utilization in Dementia (RUD) scale. Monthly indirect costs were US$ 1,122.40, US$ 1,508.90 and US$ 1,644.70 stratified into mild, moderate and severe dementia, respectively. The projected annual indirect costs were US$ 13,468.80, US$ 18,106.80 and US$ 19,736.40, representing 69 to 169% of family income. This small sample showed that the impact of indirect costs with dementia in Brazil may be higher than that reported in other Latin American (LA) studies. These initial results may represent an important contribution for further research on costs with dementia in LA.
Canine middle ear effusion (MEE) is usually asymptomatic, being an incidental finding when computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head is performed for other reasons unrelated to otic disease. The clinical relevance of the presence of material in the tympanic bulla (TB) remains uncertain, and more detail about its prevalence and appearance in MRI are required. To assess the prevalence of presence of material within the TB of French bulldogs (FB) with no clinical signs suggestive of otitis (externa, media or interna) that underwent high-field MRI for other medical reasons. Two hundred fifty-two TB of 126 FB were included in this study. Nonexperimental retrospective study in which MRI images were evaluated by a board-certified veterinary radiologist. Fifty-eight per cent of the dogs had material in the TB lumen (46% of the TB) and 59% were bilaterally affected. The signal intensity of this material related to the grey matter was variable on T1w and mainly hyperintense on T2w sequences. FB are predisposed to MEE. This is important when assessing imaging studies of TB of FB with chronic otitis externa, as high percentage of cases may have concurrent MEE. MRI findings in FB with MEE are characterised by a hyperintense signal to the grey matter on T2w in most cases and variable on T1w sequences.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used successfully in human dermatology. AI utilises convolutional neural networks (CNN) to accomplish tasks such as image classification, object detection and segmentation, facilitating early diagnosis. Computer vision (CV), a field of AI, has shown great results in detecting signs of human skin diseases. Canine paw skin diseases are a common problem in general veterinary practice, and computer vision tools could facilitate the detection and monitoring of disease processes. Currently, no such tool is available in veterinary dermatology. Digital images of paws from healthy dogs and paws with pododermatitis or neoplasia were used. We tested the novel object detection model Pawgnosis, a Tiny YOLOv4 image analysis model deployed on a microcomputer with a camera for the rapid detection of canine pododermatitis and neoplasia. The prediction performance metrics used to evaluate the models included mean average precision (mAP), precision, recall, average precision (AP) for accuracy and frames per second (FPS) for speed. A large dataset labelled by a single individual (Dataset A) used to train a Tiny YOLOv4 model provided the best results with a mean mAP of 0.95, precision of 0.86, recall of 0.93 and 20 FPS. This novel object detection model has the potential for application in the field of veterinary dermatology.
Despite being classified as a high-income country, Panama still faces challenges in providing care for children and adolescents with cancer. Annually, 170 new cases of childhood cancer are diagnosed in Panama, and the survival rate is around 60%. To improve this, the establishment of a Pediatric Cancer Commission comprised of healthcare professionals and nonprofit organizations has been a critical step toward the objectives outlined in the Cure
Seven of 60 Perendale sheep within a flock developed single or multiple exophytic masses on their distal hind limbs. A mass was excised from one sheep and histological evaluation revealed epidermal and mesenchymal proliferation, papillomavirus-induced keratinocyte changes and marked keratohyalin clumping. Ovis aries papillomavirus type 2 DNA sequences were amplified using PCR.
To evaluate the results from surgical treatment of patients with mallet finger injury using a hook plate and screw. Twenty-five patients (19 males and six females) between the ages of 20 and 35 years were analyzed between May 2008 and December 2012. They were evaluated in accordance with Crawford's criteria and the mean follow-up was 18 months. The results from 10 patients (40%) were excellent and from 15 (60%), good. Twenty-one patients (84%) reported no pain, 18 months after the operation. There was no limitation to range of motion in 14 cases (56%), limitation of extension in seven (28%) and limitation of flexion in four (16%). Surgical treatment by means of open reduction and internal fixation using a hook plate and screw proved to be an excellent option for treating mallet finger fractures and was considered to be a safe and effective method.
Allergen testing is used to select antigens included in the desensitisation vaccine. Intradermal skin test (IDT) is the gold standard in cats, yet allergen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E serological testing (ASIS) is often used. Feline data are lacking regarding the agreement between IDT and ASIS results. The first objective of the study was to establish a colony of cats with naturally acquired feline atopic syndrome (FAS). Further objectives were to define their hypersensitivity disorder to detail the allergen tests results, and to assess similarity between the allergen tests. Thirty-five cats with FAS and 10 control cats. Enrolled cats went through a five phase-screening and quarantine process before joining the colony. An elimination diet trial was performed on all FAS cats. ASIS and IDT were consecutively performed on all cats under sedation. Reactions to 34 allergens were compiled for the 45 cats. Global sensitivity and specificity of ASIS were 34.7% and 78.9%, respectively. Only flea (ICC = 0.26, p = 0.040) and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (ICC = 0.48, p < 0.001) allergens had a significant intraclass correlation (weak agreement). Two FAS cats had negative tests including one cat with a concomitant food allergy. This study depicts the first reported colony of cats with naturally acquired FAS. This is the first feline study to compare and show the poor agreement between allergen tests with a panel of 34 allergens. This colony also harbours two cats with FAS with negative allergen tests. These may represent the first described cats with an intrinsic form of atopic syndrome.
In humans, figurate erythema (FE) represents a heterogenous group of dermatoses with circular or serpiginous erythematous skin lesions; FE has not been reported in cats. To report clinical and histological characteristics and outcomes of FE in sphynx cats from Baltic sea-bordering countries. Eleven client-owned sphynx cats with FE. We recruited cases meeting the following criteria: (i) a sphynx breed, (ii) FE with or without scaling, (iii) a chronic, waxing-and-waning course lasting longer than a month and (iv) an absence of other skin diseases. Of 11 cats, there were seven Donskoys, one Peterbald, one Ukrainian Levkoy and two presumed Canadian sphynxes; all except one were males, and the age of onset was <12 months in eight cats. Skin lesions lasted between 1.2 and 56 months, and they consisted of erythematous plaques with a linear-to-serpiginous, annular, gyrate or iris configuration predominating on the trunk and extremities. Scaling was often seen trailing the edge of the centrifugally expanding erythema. All cats were otherwise asymptomatic or mildly pruritic. Dermatophytosis was ruled out by special stains and/or fungal cultures in eight cats. Microscopic lesions revealed focal, mild-to-moderate epidermal hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis, minimal-to-mild dysplasia and subepidermal collagen smudging. Special stains were negative for dermatophytes. The clinical remission of FE was not achieved with diet changes or medical interventions; yet, a spontaneous, transient, partial or complete improvement occurred in most cats. This is the first report of FE in sphynx cats from Eastern Europe.
Intradermal (IDT) and prick (PT) tests are used to select allergens for allergen-specific immunotherapy in dogs with atopic dermatitis (cAD). However, the use of antipruritic drugs before performing these tests may influence the results. To evaluate the influence of the drugs oclacitinib and prednisolone on the immediate-phase reactions of IDT and PT. Thirty client-owned dogs with cAD with positive reactions to at least one allergen extract on IDT or PT. Dogs were randomly assigned to receive oclacitinib 0.4-0.58 mg/kg per os, every 12 h (n = 14), or prednisolone 0.37-0.65 mg/kg p.o., every 12 h (n = 16) for 14 days. IDT and PT were performed on Day (D)0 before treatment and on D14. At D14 there was no significant reduction in the means of the orthogonal diameters of the positive immediate-phase reactions of the IDT (p = 0.064) in the oclacitinib group; however, in the PT, the diameter of the positive reactions reduced significantly (p = 0.048). In both tests, there was no significant reduction in the total number of positive reactions (IDT, p > 0.999; PT, p = 0.735). In the prednisolone group, the means of the orthogonal diameters of positive immediate-phase reactions were significantly reduced in both tests (IDT, p = 0.001; PT, p ≤ 0.001) and there also was a reduction in the total number of positive reactions (IDT, p = 0.022; PT, p = 0.001). The use of oclacitinib 0.4-0.58 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days does not interfere with IDT results in dogs with cAD. However, oclacitinib may reduce PT reactivity. The use of prednisolone 0.37-0.65 mg/kg twice daily results in a reduction in both IDT and PT results.
Polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil (HCO ethoxylates) is a nonionic surfactant used as an excipient for ointments and injections in human and veterinary drugs. Several polyethylene glycol (PEG) derivatives can be obtained depending on the number of moles of ethylene oxide (EO). HCO ethoxylates have the potential to cause anaphylactoid reactions. There is little published information about these types of reactions in dogs. To determine the potential for HCO-ethoxylate-containing drugs to cause anaphylactoid reactions in dogs, employing intradermal testing (IDT) with various concentrations of HCO ethoxylates (HCO-25, -40, -60 and -80). Four healthy male laboratory dogs. We performed IDT with drugs containing HCO ethoxylates and HCO ethoxylates alone to determine threshold concentrations. The IDT scores and threshold concentrations were compared. Analysis of skin biopsies from IDT sites was used to measure the percentage of degranulated mast cells. The effect of histamine at IDT sites was investigated by pre-treatment with an antihistamine. All HCO-ethoxylate-containing drugs caused a wheal-and-flare reaction. The threshold concentrations (0.001% and 0.00001%) of each HCO-ethoxylate depended on the number of moles of EO (p < 0.05). Mast cell degranulation was enhanced by all HCO ethoxylates. The HCO-60-induced reaction was suppressed by an oral antihistamine. The threshold concentration can serve as a consideration for developing safe new drug formulations and for clinical decision-making around using drugs containing PEG derivatives. IDT is useful to predict the risk of adverse effects. Antihistamines could demonstrate a prophylactic effect.
Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and can lead to neurological complications in severe cases.  This study examined neuroimaging patterns in chikungunya cases during two outbreaks in Brazil to identify specific patterns for diagnosis and treatment of neuro-chikungunya.  Eight patients with confirmed chikungunya and neurological involvement were included. Clinical examinations and MRI scans were performed, and findings were analyzed by neuroradiologists. Data on age, sex, neurological symptoms, diagnostic tests, MRI findings, and clinical outcomes were recorded.  Patients showed different neuroimaging patterns. Six patients exhibited a "clock dial pattern" with hyperintense dotted lesions in the spinal cord periphery. One patient had thickening and enhancement of anterior nerve roots. Brain MRI revealed multiple hyperintense lesions in the white matter, particularly in the medulla oblongata, in six patients. One patient had a normal brain MRI.  The "clock dial pattern" observed in spinal cord MRI may be indicative of chikungunya-related nervous system lesions. Isolated involvement of spinal cord white matter in chikungunya can help differentiate it from other viral infections. Additionally, distinct brainstem involvement in chikungunya-associated encephalitis, particularly in the rostral region, sets it apart from other arboviral infections. Recognizing these neuroimaging patterns can contribute to early diagnosis and appropriate management of neuro-chikungunya.
The application of botulinum toxin (BoNT) in the treatment of blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm (HS) is a well-established practice. However, neurology residency programs often rely on real patients for training, which has limitations in terms of patient availability and skill acquisition.  Assess the efficacy of a new facial phantom model for acquiring motor skills in BoNT application.  An anthropomorphic facial phantom model was developed in collaboration with a medical training simulator start-up. A group of seven neurologists and one ophthalmologist with expertise in BoNT application evaluated the model using an adapted learning object review instrument (LORI). The instrument assessed aspects such as: content quality, alignment of learning objectives, feedback and adaptation, motivation, presentation design, and accessibility.  The facial phantom model received high scores in the LORI evaluation, with the highest ratings given to alignment with learning objectives and motivation. The model also scored well in terms of accessibility, content quality, and presentation design. However, feedback and adaptation received a lower score due to the static nature of the model.  The facial phantom model shows promise as a valuable tool for teaching and developing competence in BoNT application for HS and blepharospasm. The model reduces the reliance on real patients for training, providing a broader and safer learning experience for neurology residents. It also provides a realistic learning experience and offers portability, cost-effectiveness, and ease of manufacturing for use in various medical training scenarios. It is an effective and accessible tool for teaching BoNT application.
Many patients with dementia live within the community supported by their family and friends. Majority of patient caregivers suffer from high levels of stress. A quasi-experimental study, which compared the effects of nursing interventions on behavior disorders in both patients with moderate to severe dementia and their caregivers, followed over 18 months. The assessments were performed at the outpatient clinic of the Federal University of São Paulo and again at patients' homes with their primary caregiver, after informed consent form. Measurements were performed at baseline and after 18 months (pre and post-test). The instruments used were: The CDR, NPI and NPI-D; Katz Index and FAQ. Simultaneously, caregivers were enrolled onto the Dementia Education Program. The final sample was composed of 31 subjects, having a mean age of 77.4 y.o. (±8 SD). Nursing interventions were effective in reducing some of the behavioral disturbances (Z= -3.1; p=0.002), such as Aggression (Z= -3.7; p<0.001) and anxiety (Z= -2.3; p=0.023). Caregiver distress also reduced upon interventions (Z= -2.2; p=0.030). Our results indicate nursing interventions may be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of behavioral disorders and subjective burden among caregivers. Education Programs can improve caregiver burden through conveying information on difficulties related to the disease and how to deal with them.
The planning, monitoring, and evaluation of food and nutrition actions depend on reliable estimates based on adequate anthropometric data. The study aimed to analyze the quality of anthropometric data of children aged under 5 years in the Brazilian National Food and Nutrition Surveillance System (SISVAN) from 2008 to 2020. The sample comprised 23,453,620 children aged under 5 years. Initially, we evaluated the distribution of missing values and values outside the spectrum of the instrument, and calculated the digit preference index for weight and height. The nutritional indexes height for age (HAZ), weight for age (WAZ), and body mass index for age (BAZ) were calculated according to the World Health Organization 2006 child growth standards. Then, we identified the biologically implausible values (BIV) and calculated the standard deviation (SD) of the nutritional indexes. For each municipality, we calculated the mean and SD of HAZ and WAZ; and plotted the SD values as a function of the mean. In all Federative Units, the digit preference index reached a minimum value of 80 for height and 20 for weight. For the three nutritional indexes, there was a reduction in the frequency of BIV in the 2008-2020 period. Even after the exclusion of BIV, we identified high variability for the three nutritional indexes. The indicators evaluated showed low quality of measurement, especially in the North and Northeast regions. Our results indicate insufficient quality of anthropometric data in children aged under 5 years, and reinforce the need to invest in actions to improve the collection and recording of anthropometric information.
Household pets can carry meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) introduced to the home by their human companions. Specific factors promoting pet carriage of this pathogen have not been fully elucidated. This study evaluated MRSA cultured from pets and the home environment in households where a human infected with MRSA had been identified, and aimed to determine potential risk factors for pet MRSA carriage. Humans diagnosed with community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) skin or soft-tissue infection (SSTI) in the mid-Atlantic United States were identified. One hundred forty-two dogs and cats from 57 affected households were identified of which 134 (94.4%) pets and the household environment were sampled for bacterial culture, PCR confirmation and spa-typing for MRSA strain determination. Samples were obtained 3 months later from 86 pets. At baseline, 12 (9.0%) pets carried MRSA. Potential risk factors associated with carriage included pet bed (environmental) MRSA contamination, flea infestation and prior antimicrobial use in the pet. Pets tended to carry human-adapted MRSA strains and spa-types of MRSA isolates cultured from pets were concordant with strains cultured from the home environment in seven of eight homes (87.5%) at baseline. Results may inform risk-based veterinary clinical recommendations and provide evidence for selective pet testing as a possible alternative to early removal of pets from the homes of humans infected with MRSA. MRSA contamination of the home environment is likely an important risk factor for pet MRSA carriage, and household interventions should be considered to reduce risk of MRSA carriage in exposed pets.
To determine the association between medial femoral condyle hypoplasia and trochlear dysplasia by analyzing the knee magnetic resonance imaging scans of young patients with or without trochlear dysplasia. This was a retrospective analysis of magnetic resonance imaging scans of the knees of young individuals (16-35 years of age): 30 patients with trochlear dysplasia and 30 individuals with no signs of patellofemoral instability. The ratios between the depth, width, and height of the medial and lateral femoral condyles (dLC/dMC, wLC/wMC, and hLC/hMC, respectively) were calculated, as was the ratio between the width of the medial condyle and the total width of the femur (wMC/FW). All of the values were determined in consensus by two radiologists. We evaluated 60 patients: 30 with trochlear dysplasia and 30 without. The mean dLC/dMC, wLC/wMC, and hLC/hMC ratios were higher in the patients than in the controls ( Our findings confirm our hypothesis that trochlear dysplasia is associated with medial condyle hypoplasia.
Evolutionary transitions between habitats have been catalysts for some of the most stunning examples of adaptive diversification, with novel niches and new resources providing ecological opportunity for such radiations. In aquatic animals, transitions from saltwater to freshwater habitats are rare, but occur often enough that in the Neotropics for example, marine-derived fishes contribute noticeably to regional ichthyofaunal diversity. Here, we investigate how morphology has evolved in a group of temperate fishes that contain a marine to freshwater transition: the sculpins (Percomorpha; Cottoidea). We devised a novel method for classifying dietary niche and relating functional aspects of prey to their predators. Coupled with functional measurements of the jaw apparatus in cottoids, we explored whether freshwater sculpins have fundamentally changed their niche after invading freshwater (niche lability) or if they retain a niche similar to their marine cousins (niche conservatism). Freshwater sculpins exhibit both phylogeographical and ecological signals of phylogenetic niche conservatism, meaning that regardless of habitat, sculpins fill similar niche roles in either saltwater or freshwater. Rather than competition guiding niche conservatism in freshwater cottoids, we argue that strong intrinsic constraints on morphological and ecological evolution are at play, contra to other studies of diversification in marine-derived freshwater fishes. However, several intertidal and subtidal sculpins as well as several pelagic freshwater species from Lake Baikal show remarkable departures from the typical sculpin bauplan. Our method of prey categorization provides an explicit, quantitative means of classifying dietary niche for macroevolutionary studies, rather than relying on somewhat arbitrary means used in previous literature.
Horseshoes with modified contact surfaces combined with deformable ground substrates are used to change hoof orientation during mid-stance, for example, for therapeutic reasons. To measure the effect of horseshoes and ground substrates on sagittal and transverse plane hoof orientation at mid-stance using a dorsal hoof wall mounted triaxial accelerometer. In vivo experiment, randomised crossover design. Differences in sagittal and transverse plane angles between standing and mid-stance of the left front hoof of six horses walking with regular horseshoes, egg bar, toe-wide, medial-wide, lateral-wide and three-degree egg bar shoes on turf, sand and hard ground substrates were assessed with linear mixed models with horseshoe and substrate type as fixed factors (p < 0.05) for each animal. Hoof angles were significantly affected by horseshoe (p < 0.001), surface (p < 0.001) and the combination (p < 0.001). The sagittal plane angle increased in deformable ground substrates at walk-in mid-stance on turf [mean (±standard deviation): 2.6° (±3.8°)] and on sand [2.6° (±4.1°)] across all shoes. The greatest increase was observed with egg bar shoes [turf: 4.37° (±3.82°); sand 4.69° (±3.83°)]. There was a tendency for the hoof to sink laterally into deformable ground substrates among all shoes [turf: 1.11° (±1.49°); sand: 0.93° (±1.93°)]. Medial-wide shoes increased the lateral sinking [turf: 2.00° (±1.63°); sand: 1.79° (±1.58°)]. Lateral-wide shoes reduced the lateral sinking on turf [0.62° (±1.26°)] and induced a marginal medial sinking on sand [-0.007° (±2.03°)]. The substrate properties were not quantitatively assessed, and observations were limited to front hooves at the walk. A larger sample size would be preferable. Mid-stance hoof orientation changes with specific combinations of shoes and ground substrates in the walking horse.
to verify the implications of practical activities in the Skills and Simulation Laboratory on the motivation and feelings expressed by undergraduate students when returning to face-to-face activities after the social isolation caused by COVID-19 pandemic. a quasi-experimental study, with a single group and of the pre- and post-test type, carried out through an educational intervention based on skills training on medication administration and venipuncture, with medical students from a Brazilian public university. The sample was comprised by 47 students. The instruments of students' characterization and self-perceived feelings and the Situational Motivation Scale were used for data collection. in the sample, 98% mentioned the lack of practical activities during the pandemic. The most frequently described feeling was anxiety. After carrying out the activity, there was a change in the frequency of expressed feelings, although there was no significant change in motivational levels. External Regulation (5.1 - 5.6), Identified Regulation (6.1 - 6.4) and Intrinsic Motivation (5.6 - 6.0) presented high results, showing similarity to the feelings reported by the learners. motivation is essential for effective learning and the use of active methodologies reinforces skills built in an affective way in the students facing the learning process.
Complicated treatments for skin disease are linked to owner-caregiver burden and poorer perception of the veterinarian-client relationship, regardless of disease severity. Using experimental vignettes, we explored the impact on owner perception of the interaction of treatment complexity and skin disease outcomes. We hypothesised that: (i) vignette conditions involving injection therapy would result in lower burden, better veterinary-client relationship and greater satisfaction relative to multimodal therapy conditions; (ii) the vignette condition of injection therapy with a completely effective outcome would be superior to all other conditions; (iii) ineffective vignette conditions would be inferior to all other conditions; and (iv) the vignette condition injection with a mostly effective outcome would be similar or superior to the multimodal therapy with a completely effective outcome condition. Three hundred and nine owners of pruritic dogs recruited from a general veterinary practice, pet-related podcast, or social media dog allergy group. Participants were presented with six counterbalanced online vignettes representing three levels of treatment effectiveness (Completely Effective, Mostly Effective, Ineffective) and two treatment regimens (Multimodal, Injection). Measurements of participant perceptions of caregiver burden, veterinarian-client relationship and satisfaction were recorded. Injection with perfect outcome was superior to other conditions (p < 0.001). Conditions with poor effectiveness were inferior (p < 0.001). Comparison of Injection with a mostly effective outcome to Multimodal treatment with perfect outcome yielded small-to-medium effects of preference for the latter in veterinarian-client relationship and satisfaction (p < 0.01); no difference was observed for caregiver burden. When good effectiveness was assured, injection was preferred (p < 0.001). Owners preferred a Completely Effective outcome and were prepared to select the Injection regimen or Multimodal therapy to achieve this; Injection was preferred when effectiveness was assured.
The present essay is aimed at getting the radiologist familiar with the basic histological skin structure, allowing for a better correlation with sonographic findings. A high-frequency (22 MHz) ultrasonography apparatus was utilized in the present study. The histological analysis was performed after the skin specimens fixation with formalin, inclusion in paraffin blocks and subsequent staining with hematoxylin-eosin. The authors present a literature review showing the relationship between sonographic and histological findings in normal cutaneous tissue, and discuss the technique for a better performance of the sonographic scan. High-frequency ultrasonography is an excellent tool for the diagnosis of different skin conditions. However, as this method is operator-dependent, it is crucial to understand the normal skin structure as well as the correlation between histological and sonographic findings.
Three outbreaks of herpesvirus meningoencephalitis in cattle have been reported in three municipalities in the northern region of the State of Tocantins, Brazil. In one outbreak, 41 predominantly young bovines were affected, with 2-3 deaths in some cases. The animals showed neurological signs of incoordination, blindness, and recumbency, with death occurring within approximately 4-5 d. At necropsy, hyperemia and leptomeningeal hemorrhages were observed in the brain. Histology revealed more intense lesions in the rostral portions of the brain, mainly affecting the frontoparietal cerebral cortex, with nonsuppurative encephalitis and meningitis, glial nodules, neuronophagia, and eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies in the astrocytes and neurons. This study shows the presence of bovine herpesvirus in Tocantins, probably the highly neurotropic type 5 strain, and emphasizes its importance in the differential diagnosis of bovine neuropathies.
Straelensia cynotis is a trombidioid mite that causes painful, usually nonpruritic nodular dermatitis mainly in the dorsal region of dogs. This case report describes the first observation of feline straelensiosis in Europe with clinicopathological findings. Molecular characterisation of the parasite was performed and compared with mites collected from dogs.
In the present study we investigated the involvement of free fatty acid (FFA) receptors in the anti-inflammatory role of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in dystrophic muscles, by administering FFA blockers in the mdx mouse model of dystrophy. Mdx mice (3 months-old) were treated with fish oil capsules (FDC Vitamins; 0.4 g EPA and 0.2 g DHA; gavage) alone or concomitant to FFA1 and FFA4 blockers (GW1100 and AH7614; i.p.). C57BL/10 mice (3 months-old) and untreated-mdx mice received mineral oil and were used as controls. After 1 month of treatment, plasma markers of myonecrosis (total and cardiac creatine kinase; CK), the levels of FFA1 and FFA4 and of the markers of inflammation, nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NFkB), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) were analyzed in the diaphragm muscle and heart by western blot. Fish oil significantly reduced total CK, cardiac CK and the levels of NFkB (diaphragm), and of TNF-α and IL-1β (diaphragm and heart) in mdx. In the dystrophic diaphragm, FFA1 was increased compared to normal. Blockers of FFA1 and FFA4 significantly inhibited the effects of fish oil treatment in both dystrophic muscles. The anti-inflammatory effects of fish oil in dystrophic diaphragm muscle and heart were mediated through FFA1 and FFA4.
The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and its Member States have been leading the efforts to eradicate wild poliovirus in the Region of Americas since smallpox's successful elimination in 1971. The region became the first to be certified free of wild poliovirus in 1994. However, in July 2022, an unvaccinated patient with no recent travel history was diagnosed with poliomyelitis in the United States of America. In response to the emergence of a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus in the United States, PAHO established the Polio Incident Management Support Team. This team has been coordinating response efforts, focusing on: coordination, planning, and monitoring; risk communication and community engagement; surveillance and case investigation; vaccination; and rapid response. In this paper, we identified and documented best practices observed following establishment of the Incident Management Support Team (September 2022-2023) through a comprehensive review and analysis of various data sources and country-specific data from the polio surveillance dashboard. The aim was to share these best practices, highlighting technical support and implementation of polio measures by Member States. Despite several challenges, the Americas region remains polio-free. Polio risk is declining, with a July 2023 assessment showing fewer countries at medium, high, and very high risk. This progress reflects improved immunization coverage, surveillance, containment, health determinants, and outbreak preparedness and response. The PAHO Polio Incident Management Support Team has played a key role in supporting these efforts.
Allermmune HDM (Zenoaq) is a recombinant Dermatophagoides farinae 2 (Der f 2) pullulan-based immunotherapy vaccine whose efficacy on house dust mite allergic dogs has been demonstrated. There is no published information on its use in cats. The objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and short-term effects of Allermmune HDM in Dermatophagoides farinae (Df)-sensitised cats. Eleven cats diagnosed with atopic skin syndrome received Allermmune weekly for six weeks then monthly for three months (total duration 18 weeks). On Weeks 0, 6 and 18 clinical lesions were assessed by the Feline Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index (FEDESI); owners assessed pruritus with a 10-cm Visual Analog Scale (pVAS). Concurrent medication use was recorded. The allergen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E were measured before study inclusion with a commercial serological assay. There were no evident adverse effects. FEDESI and pVAS improved significantly after six weeks (p = 0.001 and p = 0.01, respectively). The pretreatment Df-specific IgE levels were significantly higher in the cats with improved clinical scores than in the cats with no clinical score change (p = 0.009). Allermmune HDM may be safe in cats and has the potential to alleviate signs of atopic skin syndrome. Allergen-specific IgE levels may represent an efficacy marker. Controlled studies of longer duration and larger sample size are worth pursuing.
this meta-analysis study analyzed the effect of foot reflexology on fatigue in hemodialysis patients by combining the results of independent studies on this subject. meta-analysis study. A literature search was conducted in seven databases. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using tools proposed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis v3 was used for meta-analysis. eight studies were included in the meta-analysis. The result of the meta-analysis standardized mean difference = 1.580 (95% Confidence Interval = 1.075 - 2.085 p = 0.000). The result of the subgroup analysis performed based on the number of foot reflexology sessions standardized mean difference = 1,478 (95% Confidence Interval = 1,210 - 1,747, p = 0.000). it was concluded that foot reflexology can be used to reduce fatigue in hemodialysis patients. No information was provided in the investigated studies about the possible side effects and negative effects of foot reflexology. (1) This study found that foot reflexology reduced fatigue levels. (2) The 10-session foot reflexology was the most effective. (3) This study will guide nurses and health workers. (4) Reflexology is one of the non-pharmacological methods used to relieve fatigue.
During the pandemic, "staying at home" was not an option for many people, especially health workers, who were on the front lines in the fight against COVID-19 and whose mental health was threatened. This study highlights the psychological repercussions of the pandemic and the coping strategies used by health workers in an effort to develop mental health resources. This qualitative exploratory study investigated the narratives of 14 health workers from an online focus group between August and September 2020, transcribing the meetings and performing thematic content analysis. The analysis resulted in 3 categories of experience: 1) the professional as a patient, especially the fear of suffering or dying based on daily experience; 2) the fine line between providing care and being a vector of transmission, which identified worries about infecting family members and work overload; and 3) coping strategies and mental health on an individual level, such as routines, care, faith, and learning lessons, as well as on a collective level, such as prevention measures and public policies. Studies such as this can contribute to a framework of knowledge about coping strategies to maintain mental health among health workers. They also provide an opportunity to listen, which produces meaning, empathy, and recognition for these professionals.
To analyze the results of biomechanical assays of the fixation of Pauwels type II femoral neck fractures in synthetic bones, using two parallel cannulated screws or three cannulated screws in an inverted pyramid formation. Ten Brazilian-made synthetic bones were divided into 2 groups. Groups A and B utilized three and two cannulated screws, respectively, after osteotomy in the middle third of the femur, perpendicular to the axis of the femoral neck, simulating a Pauwels type II femoral neck fracture. The resistance of these fixations was analyzed by compression on the axis of the force resulting from hip compression, simulated with a manual hydraulic press. The T-test and post hoc analysis were used to compare the groups, and the significance criterion adopted was p < 0.05. In group A, which used fixation with three screws, synthesis failure was seen at a mean force of 526 N. In group B, which used two screws, the mean force was 466 N. The results presented a statistically significant difference (p = 0.02). The osteosynthesis of femoral neck fractures in synthetic bone fixated with two screws presented inferior results to fixation with three screws.
Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and S. aureus are bacterial species of importance in veterinary medicine. The increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance necessitates the implementation of novel treatment modalities. Fluorescent light energy (FLE) is used as an adjunctive and primary treatment for canine pyoderma. However, no in vitro studies exist investigating its bactericidal effects against S. pseudintermedius or S. aureus. To determine the bactericidal effects of FLE on S. pseudintermedius and S. aureus isolates. Two meticillin-susceptible S. pseudintermedius (MSSP) isolates, three meticillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) isolates and one meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolate were studied. A commercially available blue light-emitting diode (bLED) lamp and photoconverting hydrogel FLE system was used. All bacteria were exposed to five conditions following inoculation: (i) no treatment (control); (ii) blue light (bLED) once; (iii) bLED twice consecutively; (iv) FLE (bLED and photoconverting hydrogel) once; and (v) FLE (bLED and photoconverting hydrogel) twice consecutively. Each individual exposure was 2 min long. No statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found for any treatment group when each bacterial isolate was evaluated individually, MSSP isolates were grouped, MRSP isolates were grouped, when all S. pseudintermedius isolates were combined, or when all isolates of both Staphylococcus species were combined. While clinical success is reported when using FLE to treat Staphylococcus infections in animals, no in vitro antibacterial efficacy was identified for S. pseudintermedius or S. aureus under experimental conditions. The clinical success observed with FLE may be the result of a more complex in vivo response.
Central Illustration : Performance of the SHARPEN Score and the Charlson Comorbidity Index for In-Hospital and Post-Discharge Mortality Prediction in Infective Endocarditis. SHARPEN was the first dedicated score for in-hospital mortality prediction in infective endocarditis (IE) regardless of cardiac surgery. To analyze the ability of the SHARPEN score to predict in-hospital and post-discharge mortality and compare it with that of the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). Retrospective cohort study including definite IE (Duke modified criteria) admissions from 2000 to 2016. The area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) was calculated to assess predictive ability. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression was performed. P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We studied 179 hospital admissions. In-hospital mortality was 22.3%; 68 (38.0%) had cardiac surgery. Median (interquartile range, IQR) SHARPEN and CCI scores were 9(7-11) and 3(2-6), respectively. SHARPEN had better in-hospital mortality prediction than CCI in non-operated patients (AUC-ROC 0.77 vs. 0.62, p = 0.003); there was no difference in overall (p = 0.26) and in operated patients (p = 0.41). SHARPEN > 10 at admission was associated with decreased in-hospital survival in the overall (HR 3.87; p < 0.001), in non-operated (HR 3.46; p = 0.006) and operated (HR 6.86; p < 0.001) patients. CCI > 3 at admission was associated with worse in-hospital survival in the overall (HR 3.0; p = 0.002), and in operated patients (HR 5.57; p = 0.005), but not in non-operated patients (HR 2.13; p = 0.119). Post-discharge survival was worse in patients with SHARPEN > 10 (HR 3.11; p < 0.001) and CCI > 3 (HR 2.63; p < 0.001) at admission; however, there was no difference in predictive ability between these groups. SHARPEN was superior to CCI in predicting in-hospital mortality in non-operated patients. There was no difference between the scores regarding post-discharge mortality.
Knowledge of the anatomical variations of the visceral branches of the abdominal aorta is important information for planning any surgeries in the region. We present here a rare constellation of variations of visceral vessels around the kidneys with a brief review of the recent literature. On the right side, an accessory renal artery was observed originating just distal to the main renal artery. The middle suprarenal artery was absent on the right side and there were two inferior suprarenal arteries originating from a branch of the main right renal artery. On the left side, the testicular artery had an arched course anterior to the left renal vein mimicking an unusual variety of nutcracker phenomenon. The right kidney was drained by two renal veins into the inferior vena cava. Knowledge of the coexistence of such complex anatomical variations might be helpful for clinicians during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
We estimated trends in the prevalence of obesity and overweight among Chilean primary and secondary students before and after Chile's 2016 regulations on the marketing and availability of foods high in energy, total sugars, sodium, or saturated fat. We used data from Chile's Survey of Nutrition, which measured the body mass index (BMI) of students in government-funded schools. Using BMI thresholds defined by the World Health Organization, we calculated the prevalence of overweight and obesity for each year from 2013 to 2019 among students attending pre-kindergarten (age 4 years), kindergarten (age 5 years), first grade (6 years), and ninth grade (14 years). In ninth grade students, overweight and obesity prevalence rose by 2 percentage points over the 3 years after introduction of the 2016 regulations. In pre-kindergarten, kindergarten, and first grade, overweight and obesity fell 1 to 3 percentage points 1 year after the regulations were introduced, but rebounded to previous levels the next year. Chile's food regulations were not followed by a sustained decline in obesity in primary- and secondary-school students. Future research should examine whether and how children in Chile and other countries maintain high levels of overweight and obesity despite food regulations designed to reduce consumption of obesogenic foods and beverages.
This case report describes the exercise program on a hospitalized 54-year-old male patient with cardiogenic shock waiting for a heart transplant assisted by an intra-aortic balloon pump, a temporary mechanical circulatory support device. The temporary mechanical circulatory support device, an intra-aortic balloon pump, was placed in the left subclavian artery, enabling the exercise protocol. Measurements and values from Swan-Ganz catheter, blood sample, brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), as well as the six-minute walk test (6MWT) and venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) were obtained before and after an exercise protocol. The exercise training protocol involved the use of an unloaded bed cycle ergometer once a day, for a maximum of 30 minutes, to the tolerance limit. No adverse events or events related to the dislocation of the intra-aortic balloon pump were observed during the exercise protocol. The exercise program resulted in higher SvO2 levels, with an increased 6MWT with lower Borg dyspnea scores (312 meters vs. 488 meters and five points vs. three points, respectively). After completing the ten-day exercise protocol, the patient underwent a non-complicated heart transplant surgery and a full recovery in the ICU. This study showed that exercise is a feasible option for patients with cardiogenic shock who are using an intra-aortic balloon pump and that it is well-tolerated with no reported adverse events.
The infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads worldwide and is considered a pandemic. The most common manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (coronavirus disease 2019 - COVID-19) is viral pneumonia with varying degrees of respiratory compromise and up to 40% of hospitalized patients might develop acute respiratory distress syndrome. Several clinical trials evaluated the role of corticosteroids in non-COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome with conflicting results. We designed a trial to evaluate the effectiveness of early intravenous dexamethasone administration on the number of days alive and free of mechanical ventilation within 28 days after randomization in adult patients with moderate or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to confirmed or probable COVID-19. This is a pragmatic, prospective, randomized, stratified, multicenter, open-label, controlled trial including 350 patients with early-onset (less than 48 hours before randomization) moderate or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, defined by the Berlin criteria, due to COVID-19. Eligible patients will be randomly allocated to either standard treatment plus dexamethasone (Intervention Group) or standard treatment without dexamethasone (Control Group). Patients in the intervention group will receive dexamethasone 20mg intravenous once daily for 5 days, followed by dexamethasone 10mg IV once daily for additional 5 days or until intensive care unit discharge, whichever occurs first. The primary outcome is ventilator-free days within 28 days after randomization, defined as days alive and free from invasive mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes are all-cause mortality rates at day 28, evaluation of the clinical status at day 15 assessed with a 6-level ordinal scale, mechanical ventilation duration from randomization to day 28, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score evaluation at 48 hours, 72 hours and 7 days and intensive care unit -free days within 28.
Comparative analyses based on clinical performance indicators to monitor the quality of hospital care have been carried out for decades in several countries, most notably the hospital standardized mortality ratio (HSMR). In Brazil, studies and the adoption of methodological tools that allow regular analysis of the performance of institutions are still scarce. This study aimed to assess the use of HSMR to compare the performance of hospitals funded by the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS). The Hospital Information System was the source of data on adult hospitalizations in Brazil from 2017 to 2019. The methodological approach to estimate HSMR was adapted to the available data and included the causes of hospitalization (main diagnosis) responsible for 80% of deaths. The number of expected deaths was estimated using a logistic regression model that included predictor variables widely described in the literature. The analysis was conducted in two stages: (i) hospitalization level and (ii) hospital level. The final risk adjustment model showed a C-statistic of 0.774, which is considered adequate. The variation in HSMR was wide, especially among the worst-performing hospitals (1.54 to 6.77). Private hospitals performed better than public hospitals. Although the limits of the available data and the challenges still face its more refined use, HSMR is applicable and has the potential to become an important tool for assessing hospital performance in the SUS.
